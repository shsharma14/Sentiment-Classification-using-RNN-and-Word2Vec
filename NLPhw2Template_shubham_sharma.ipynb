              "'\\nArgentine professional footballer\\nFilms\\nLionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation:\\xa0[ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (listen); born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for  Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d\\'Or awards,[note 2] a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d\\'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga season (21) and the Copa América (17). He also holds the record for most international goals by a South American male (80). Messi has scored over 750 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club.\\nBorn and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d\\'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d\\'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times and in a row.[10] During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d\\'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d\\'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d\\'Or. Out of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi is both his country\\'s highest appearance-maker and their all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup in 2006, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad\\'s captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and won the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot award for the latter. This achievement would see him receive a record seventh Ballon d\\'Or in 2021.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world\\'s highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world\\'s highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019. Messi was among Time\\'s 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, thus becoming the first footballer and the first team sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer (and second team-sport athlete) to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.\\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[11] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father\\'s side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic Marche region of Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother\\'s side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[5] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \"Leo\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[12] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[13] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[14][15]\\n\"When you saw him you would think: this kid can\\'t play ball. He\\'s a dwarf, he\\'s too fragile, too small. But immediately you\\'d realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive.\"\\n– Newell\\'s Old Boys youth coach Adrián Coria shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi.[16]\\nA lifelong supporter of Newell\\'s Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell\\'s, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \"The Machine of \\'87\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team\\'s home games.[17][18] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, at age 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father\\'s health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell\\'s agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[19] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they were also unable to pay for his treatment due to Argentina\\'s economic collapse.[20][21] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I\\'ve ever seen\".[22]\\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[20][23] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club\\'s stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell\\'s; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.[17][23][24]\\nAfter a year at Barcelona\\'s youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué.[25] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[26] Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona\\'s greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[25][27] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[28] At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.[23][29][30]\\n\"It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life.\"\\n– Barcelona\\'s then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi\\'s first-team debut.[31]\\nDuring the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club\\'s ranks, debuting for a record five youth teams in a single campaign.[32] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[33][34] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how a teenage Leo caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard\\'s first team: \"He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team\\'s starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.\"[35]\\nAt 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José Mourinho\\'s Porto on 16 November 2003.[23][36] His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club\\'s reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[37] After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça\\'s new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.[38] Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called \"little brother\", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.[39][40]\\nTo gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in addition to the Juveniles A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla\\'s Sergio Ramos.[33][41] His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30\\xa0million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80\\xa0million.[33][42] He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.[43] Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the Juveniles B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[33][41]\\nDuring the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring on six occasions.[38][44] Since his debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him.[38] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player\\'s wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[45][46] Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol, coming on in the 82nd minute.[23] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.[40] As a substitute player, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk.[44] He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[45][47] Barcelona, in their second season under Rijkaard, won the league for the first time in six years.[48]\\n\"In my entire life I have never seen a player of such quality and personality at such a young age, particularly wearing the \\'heavy\\' shirt of one of the world\\'s great clubs.\"\\n– Fabio Capello praises the 18-year-old Messi following the Joan Gamper trophy in August 2005.[49]\\nOn 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150\\xa0million.[42] His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona\\'s pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello\\'s Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.[49] While Capello requested to loan Messi, a bid to buy him came from Inter Milan, who were willing to pay his €150\\xa0million buyout clause and triple his wages.[50] According to then-president Joan Laporta, it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay.[51] On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014.[42][52]\\nDue to issues regarding his legal status in the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Messi missed the start of La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play.[52][53] Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto\\'o.[30][54][55] He was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November, as well as Barcelona\\'s away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of the Champions League,[56][54] which came on back of an intense period of rivalry between the clubs leading a resentful Messi to state, \"We would rather play Arsenal, Manchester United or anyone else than be on the pitch with Chelsea.\"[57] After he had scored 8 goals in 25 games, including his first in the Champions League,[58] in a 5–0 win over Panathinaikos on 2 November 2005,[59] his season ended prematurely during the return leg against Chelsea on 7 March 2006, when he suffered a torn hamstring. Messi worked to regain fitness in time for the Champions League final, but on 17 May, the day of the final, he was eventually ruled out. He was so disappointed that he did not celebrate his team\\'s victory over Arsenal in Paris, something he later came to regret.[48][54]\\nWhile Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006–07 campaign.[60][61] Already an idol to the culés, the club\\'s supporters, he scored 17 goals in 36 games across all competitions.[61][62] However, he continued to be plagued by major injuries; a metatarsal fracture sustained on 12 November 2006 kept him out of action for three months.[63][64] He recovered in time for the last 16 round of the Champions League against Liverpool, but was effectively marked out of the game; Barcelona, the reigning champions, were out of the competition.[65] In the league, his goal contribution increased towards the end of the season; 11 of his 14 goals came from the last 13 games.[62] On 10 March 2007, he scored his first hat-trick in a Clásico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3–3 draw in injury time.[66] His growing importance to the club was reflected in a new contract, signed that month, which greatly increased his wages.[67]\\nAlready frequently compared to compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi proved their similarity when he nearly replicated Maradona\\'s two most famous goals in the span of seven weeks.[68] During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably similar to Maradona\\'s second goal in the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, known as the Goal of the Century. Messi collected the ball on the right side near the halfway line, ran 60 metres (66\\xa0yd), and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done.[20][69] A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona\\'s Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match.[70] As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.[71][72]\\nAfter Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Barça\\'s new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname \"Messiah\" from the Spanish media.[20][73][74] His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d\\'Or, behind Kaká and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kaká.[75][76] Although he managed to score 16 goals  during the 2007–08 campaign,[77] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[78] He returned to score twice in their away victory against Celtic in the last 16 round of the Champions League, becoming the competition\\'s top scorer at that point with six goals,[79] but reinjured himself during the return leg on 4 March 2008. Rijkaard had fielded him despite warning from the medical staff, leading captain Carles Puyol to criticise the Spanish media for pressuring Messi to play every match.[78] Barcelona finished the season without trophies, eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Manchester United, and placed third in the league.[80]\\nAfter two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an overhaul, leading to the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter\\'s departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[55] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of €7.8\\xa0million, becoming the club\\'s highest-paid player.[81][82] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[64][83] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[75][84]\\nIn his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008–09 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games, contributing alongside Eto\\'o and winger Thierry Henry to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.[85][86] During his first season under Barcelona\\'s new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing, like he had under Rijkaard, though this time as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside and roam the centre. During the Clásico on 2 May 2009, however, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. He set up his side\\'s first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team\\'s greatest-ever score at Real Madrid\\'s Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[87][88] Returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey.[89] With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became La Liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.[85][90]\\nAs the season\\'s Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament\\'s history,[91] Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4–0 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[87] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2–0, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of €250\\xa0million, while his salary increased to €12\\xa0million.[81]\\nHis team\\'s prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year.[93] After victories in the Supercopa de España and UEFA Super Cup in August, Barcelona won the FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes de La Plata on 19 December, with Messi scoring the winning 2–1 goal with his chest.[94] At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by the greatest voting margin in each trophy\\'s history.[75]\\n\"Messi is the best player in the world by some distance. He\\'s like a PlayStation. He can take advantage of every mistake we make.\"\\n– Arsène Wenger commends Messi for his four-goal display against Arsenal in April 2010.[95]\\nThe new year, however, started on a less positive note for Barcelona, as they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Sevilla in the Round of 16.[96] Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing – with the club\\'s summer acquisition Zlatan Ibrahimović occupying the central forward role – Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010, beginning with a Champions League last 16-round match against VfB Stuttgart. After a first-leg draw, Barcelona won the second leg 4–0 with two goals and an assist from Messi. At that point, he effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola\\'s team, and his goalscoring rate increased.[97] Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions that season, equaling Ronaldo\\'s club record from the 1996–97 campaign.[98][99] He scored all of his side\\'s four goals in the Champions League quarter-final against Arsenal on 6 April while becoming Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer in the competition.[100] Although Barcelona were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Inter Milan, Messi finished the season as top scorer (with 8 goals) for the second consecutive year.[101] As the league\\'s top scorer with 34 goals (again tying Ronaldo\\'s record), he helped Barcelona win a second consecutive La Liga trophy with only a single defeat and earned his first European Golden Shoe.[99][102]\\nMessi secured Barcelona\\'s first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the Supercopa de España, by scoring a hat-trick in his side\\'s second-leg 4–0 victory over Sevilla, after a first-leg defeat.[103] Assuming a playmaking role, he was again instrumental in a Clásico on 29 November 2010, the first with José Mourinho in charge of Real Madrid, as Barcelona defeated their rivals 5–0.[104] Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011.[105][106] His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[75][107] Under the award\\'s old format, he would have placed just outside the top three, owing his win to the votes from the international coaches and captains.[107]\\nTowards the end of the season, Barcelona played four Clásicos in the span of 18 days. A league match on 16 April ended in a draw after a penalty from Messi. After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side\\'s 2–0 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals in Madrid, the second of which – a slaloming dribble past three Real players – was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition.[108] Although he did not score, he was again important in the second-leg draw that sent Barcelona through to the Champions League final,[109][110] where they faced Manchester United in a repeat of the final two years earlier. As the competition\\'s top scorer for the third consecutive year, with 12 goals, Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Barça\\'s 3–1 victory.[111][112] Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title. In addition to his 31 goals, Messi was also the league\\'s top assist provider with 18.[113][114] He finished the season with 53 goals and 24 assists in all competitions, becoming Barcelona\\'s all-time single-season top scorer and the first player in Spanish football to reach the 50-goal benchmark.[113][115]\\nAs Messi developed into a combination of a number 8 (a creator), a 9 (scorer), and a 10 (assistant),[116] he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions.[117][118][119] He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups; in the Supercopa de España, he scored three times to achieve a 5–4 aggregate victory over Real Madrid, overtaking Raúl as the competition\\'s all-time top scorer with eight goals.[120][121] At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos, earning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously.[122] For his efforts in 2011, he again received the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d\\'Or three times, after Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten.[123] Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style Ballon d\\'Or.[124] By then, Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.[24]\\n\"I feel sorry for those who want to compete for Messi\\'s throne – it\\'s impossible, this kid is unique.\"\\n– Pep Guardiola after Messi became Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer at age 24 in March 2012[125]\\nAs Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini\\'s record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez\\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\\nDespite Messi\\'s individual form, Barcelona\\'s four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club\\'s history – drew to an end.[131] Although Barcelona won the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao on 25 May, its 14th title of that period, the team lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Chelsea, with Messi sending a crucial second-leg penalty kick against the crossbar.[132][133] In Barça\\'s last home league match on 5 May, against Espanyol, Messi scored all four goals before approaching the bench to embrace Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager.[134] He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed Gerd Müller\\'s 67 goals in the 1972–73 Bundesliga season, making him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football.[135][136]\\nUnder manager Tito Vilanova, who had first coached him aged 14 at La Masia, Messi helped the club achieve its best-ever start to a La Liga season during the second half of 2012, amassing 55 points by the competition\\'s midway point, a record in Spanish football.[137] A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi break two longstanding records: he surpassed César Rodríguez\\'s record of 190 league goals, becoming Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer in La Liga, and Gerd Müller\\'s record of most goals scored in a calendar year, overtaking his 85 goals scored in 1972 for Bayern Munich and West Germany.[138] Messi sent Müller a number 10 Barcelona shirt, signed \"with respect and admiration\", after breaking his 40-year record.[139] At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina.[140] Although FIFA did not acknowledge the achievement, citing verifiability issues, he received the Guinness World Records title for most goals scored in a calendar year.[141][142] As the odds-on favourite, Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d\\'Or four times.[140][143]\\nBarcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid\\'s 100-point record of the previous season. However, their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 2012–13 campaign, concurrently with Vilanova\\'s absence due to ill health.[144] After losing successive Clásicos, including the Copa del Rey semi-finals, they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by AC Milan, but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4–0 comeback, with two goals and an assist from Messi.[145] Now in his ninth senior season with Barcelona, Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018, while his fixed wage rose to €13\\xa0million.[146][147] He wore the captain\\'s armband for the first time a month later, on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; by then, he had become the team\\'s tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, László Kubala and Johan Cruyff.[148] Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, his input into the team\\'s attack had increased; from 24% in their treble-winning campaign, his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season.[149]\\n\"In Leo we are talking about the best player in the world and when things are not going well you have to use him. Even if he is half lame, his presence on the pitch is enough to lift us and our play in general.\"\\n– Defender Gerard Piqué explains Barcelona\\'s reliance on an unfit Messi against Paris Saint-Germain in April 2013.[150]\\nAfter four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions.[151] These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona\\'s perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[151]\\nMessi continued to struggle with injury throughout 2013, eventually parting ways with his long-time personal physiotherapist.[152] Further damage to his hamstring sustained on 12 May ended his goalscoring streak of 21 consecutive league games, a worldwide record; he had netted 33 goals during his run, including a four-goal display against Osasuna, while becoming the first player to score consecutively against all 19 opposition teams in La Liga.[153][154] With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times.[155][156] Following an irregular start to the new season under manager Gerardo Martino, formerly of his boyhood club Newell\\'s Old Boys, Messi suffered his fifth injury of 2013 when he tore his hamstring on 10 November, leaving him sidelined for two months.[157][158] Despite his injuries, he was voted runner-up for the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to Cristiano Ronaldo.[159]\\nDuring the second half of the 2013–14 season, doubts persisted over Messi\\'s form, leading to a perception among the culés that he was reserving himself for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Statistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons.[160][161] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara\\'s 369 goals to become Barcelona\\'s top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[164] After prolonged speculation over his future with the club, Messi signed a new contract on 19 May 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to €20\\xa0million, or €36\\xa0million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport.[165] It was reported that Vilanova played a key role in convincing Messi to stay[166] amid strong interest from Mourinho\\'s Chelsea.[167]\\nUnder new manager and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014–15 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year.[168] A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra.[169] A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass César Rodríguez as the all-time top scorer in the Derbi barceloní with 12 goals.[170] Messi again placed second in the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina at the World Cup.[171]\\nAt the start of 2015, Barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point came on 11 January during a 3–1 victory over Atlético Madrid, the first time Barça\\'s attacking trident of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run.[172][173] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Suárez, their striker.[173][174] From there, he regained his best – arguably his best-ever – form, while Suárez and Neymar ended the team\\'s attacking dependency on their star player.[175][176] With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[177]\\nTowards the end of the campaign, Messi scored in a 1–0 away win over Atlético Madrid on 17 May, securing the La Liga title.[178] Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for Barcelona, allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra with the most hat-tricks in Spanish football.[179] As the season\\'s top assist provider with 18 he surpassed Luís Figo with the most assists in La Liga;[note 3] he made his record 106th assist in a fixture against Levante on 15 February, in which he also scored a hat-trick.[180][181][182] Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 3–1 in the Copa del Rey final on 30 May, achieving the sixth double in their history. His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.[183]\\nIn the Champions League, Messi scored twice and set up another in their 3–0 semi-final victory over Bayern Munich, now under the stewardship of Guardiola.[184] His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past Jérôme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year\\'s most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA.[185][186] Despite a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated Juventus 3–1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so.[187][188] Although Messi did not score, he participated in each of his side\\'s goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Suárez scored the match-winning goal on the rebound.[177] In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons.[189][190] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a second time.[191]\\nMessi opened the 2015–16 season by scoring twice from free kicks in Barcelona\\'s 5–4 victory (after extra time) over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[192] On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 1–1 away draw to Roma.[193] After a knee injury, he returned to the pitch on 21 November, making a substitute appearance in Barcelona\\'s 4–0 away win over rivals Real Madrid in El Clásico.[194] Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona defeated River Plate 3–0 in Yokohama.[195] On 30 December, Messi scored on his 500th appearance for Barcelona, in a 4–0 home win over Real Betis.[196]\\nOn 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or for a record fifth time in his career.[197] On 3 February, he scored a hat-trick in Barcelona\\'s 7–0 win against Valencia in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou.[198] In a 6–1 home win against Celta Vigo in the league, Messi assisted Suárez from a penalty kick. Some saw it as \"a touch of genius\", while others criticised it as being disrespectful to the opponent. The Celta players never complained and their coach defended the penalty, stating, \"Barca\\'s forwards are very respectful.\" The penalty routine has been compared to that of Barça icon Johan Cruyff in 1982, who was battling lung cancer, leading many fans to indicate that the penalty was a tribute to him. Cruyff himself was \"very happy\" with the play, insisting \"it was legal and entertaining\".[199][200]\\nOn 17 February, Messi reached his 300th league goal in a 1–3 away win against Sporting de Gijón.[201] A few days later, he scored both goals in Barcelona\\'s 0–2 win against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, in the first leg of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League round of 16, with the second goal being Barcelona\\'s 10,000th in official competitions.[202] On 17 April, Messi ended a five-match scoring drought with his 500th senior career goal for club and country in Barcelona\\'s 2–1 home loss to Valencia.[203] Messi finished the 2015–16 season by setting up both goals in Barcelona\\'s 2–0 extra time win over Sevilla in the 2016 Copa del Rey Final, at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, on 22 May 2016, as the club celebrated winning the domestic double for the second consecutive season.[204] In total, Messi scored 41 goals and provided 23 assists, as Barcelona\\'s attacking trio managed a Spanish record of 131 goals throughout the season, breaking the record they had set the previous season.[205]\\n\"[Messi] is indispensable, but the rest of us are dispensable. – No, the club is bigger than any manager, than any player... except Leo.

A week later, Messi sustained a groin injury in a 1–1 draw against Atlético Madrid and was ruled out with injury for three weeks.[211] He marked his return with a goal, scoring three minutes after coming off the bench in a 4–0 home win over Deportivo de La Coruña, on 16 October.[212] Three days after this, he netted his thirty-seventh club hat-trick as Barcelona defeated Manchester City 4–0.[213] On 1 November, Messi scored his 54th Champions League group stage goal in Barcelona\\'s 3–1 away loss to Manchester City, surpassing the previous record of 53 goals held by Raúl.[214]\\nMessi finished the year with 51 goals, making him Europe\\'s top scorer, one ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimović.[215] After placing second in the 2016 Ballon d\\'Or, on 9 January 2017 Messi also finished in second place – behind Cristiano Ronaldo once again – in the 2016 Best FIFA Men\\'s Player Award.[216] On 11 January, Messi scored from a free-kick in Barcelona\\'s 3–1 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey, which enabled Barcelona to advance to the quarter-finals of the competition; with his 26th goal from a free-kick for Barcelona in all competitions, he equalled the club\\'s all-time record, which had previously been set by Ronald Koeman.[217] In his next league match, on 14 January, Messi scored in a 5–0 win against Las Palmas; with this goal, he equalled Raúl\\'s record for the most teams scored against in La Liga (35).[218]\\nOn 4 February 2017, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Athletic Bilbao in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club\\'s all-time top-scorer from free-kicks.[219] On 23 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–2 away win over Real Madrid.

His buyout clause was set at €700\\xa0million.[233] On 7 January 2018, Messi made his 400th La Liga appearance with Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Levante, marking the occasion with his 144th league assist and 365th league goal for the club, the latter of which saw him equal Gerd Müller\\'s record for the most league goals scored for the same club in one of Europe\\'s top five divisions.[234] A week later, he broke the record, scoring his 366th La Liga goal from a free kick in a 4–2 away win against Real Sociedad.[234]\\nOn 4 March, he scored his 600th senior career goal from a free kick in a 1–0 home win over Atlético Madrid, in La Liga.[235] On 14 March, Messi scored his 99th and 100th Champions League goals in a 3–0 home win over Chelsea, becoming only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this landmark, in fewer appearances, at a younger age and having taken fewer shots than his Portuguese counterpart.[236] His opening goal, which came after only two minutes and eight seconds, was also the fastest of his career, as Barcelona advanced to the quarter-finals of the competition for the eleventh consecutive season.[237] On 7 April, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 win over Leganés including his sixth goal scored from a free-kick for the season, matching the record set by former teammate Ronaldinho.[238] He once again finished the season as the top scorer in La Liga, with 34 goals, which also saw him win his fifth Golden Shoe award.[239] On 21 April, Messi scored Barcelona\\'s second goal – his 40th of the season – in a 5–0 win over Sevilla in the 2018 Copa del Rey Final, later also setting up Suárez\\'s second goal; this was Barcelona\\'s fourth consecutive title and their 30th overall.[240] On 29 April, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 4–2 away win over Deportivo de La Coruña, which saw Barcelona claim their 25th league title.[241] On 9 May, Messi scored as Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5–1 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history.[242]\\nWith the departure of former captain Andrés Iniesta in May 2018, Messi was named the team\\'s new captain for the following season.[243] On 12 August, he lifted his first title as Barcelona\\'s captain, the Supercopa de España, following a 2–1 victory over Sevilla. On 19 August, Messi scored twice in helping Barcelona defeat Alavés 3–0 in their first La Liga match of the season, with his first goal, a free kick that he rolled under the jumping Alavés wall, making history in being Barcelona\\'s 6000th goal in La Liga.[244] On 18 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 home win over PSV Eindhoven in Barcelona\\'s opening Champions League group stage match of the season, setting a new record for most hat-tricks in the competition, with eight.[245] On 20 October, Messi scored in a 4–2 home win over Sevilla, but was later forced off in the 26th minute after falling awkwardly and injuring his right arm; tests later confirmed that he had fractured his radial bone, ruling him out for approximately three weeks.[246] On 8 December, Messi scored two free kicks – his ninth and tenth goals from set pieces during the calendar year – in a 4–0 away win over Derbi barceloní rivals Espanyol in La Liga; this was the first time ever that he had managed such a feat in the league. His first goal was also his 10th league goal of the season, making him the first player ever to reach double figures in La Liga for 13 consecutive seasons.[247]\\nOn 13 January 2019, Messi scored his 400th La Liga goal in his 435th league appearance in a 3–0 home win over Eibar, becoming the first player ever to manage this tally in just one of Europe\\'s top five leagues.[248] On 2 February, Messi scored twice in a 2–2 draw against Valencia, with his first goal coming from the penalty spot, his 50th La Liga penalty goal; as such, he became only the third player in La Liga history after Cristiano Ronaldo and Hugo Sánchez to score 50 penalties in the competition.[249] Later that month, the club admitted they had begun preparations for Messi\\'s future retirement.[250] On 23 February, Messi scored the 50th hat-trick of his career and also provided an assist for Suárez, as he helped Barcelona come from behind to achieve a 4–2 away victory over Sevilla in La Liga; the goal was also his 650th career goal for club and country at senior level.[251] On 16 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–0 home victory over Manchester United in the second leg of the Champions League quarter-finals to give Barcelona a 4–0 aggregate win, which saw Barcelona progress to the semi-finals of the competition for the first time since 2015; these were also his first goals in the Champions League quarter-finals since 2013.[252][253]\\nOn 27 April, Messi came off the bench and scored the only goal in a 1–0 home win over Levante, which allowed Barcelona to clinch the league title;[254] this was his 450th La Liga appearance, and his first league title as Barcelona\\'s captain.[255][256] On 1 May, Messi scored twice in a 3–0 home win over Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals; his second goal of the match, a 35-yard free kick, was the 600th senior club goal of his career, all of which had been scored with Barcelona.[257] In the return leg six days later at Anfield, Barcelona suffered a 4–0 away defeat, which saw Liverpool advance to the final 4–3 on aggregate.[258] On 19 May, in Barcelona\\'s final La Liga match of the season, Messi scored twice in a 2–2 away draw against Eibar (his 49th and 50th goals of the season in all competitions), which saw him capture his sixth Pichichi Trophy as the league\\'s top scorer, with 36 goals in 34 appearances; with six titles, he equalled Zarra as the player with the most top-scorer awards in La Liga.[259] He also captured his sixth Golden Shoe award, and a record third consecutive award since the 2016–17 season.[260] On 25 May, Messi scored his final goal of the season in a 2–1 defeat to Valencia in the 2019 Copa del Rey Final.[261]\\nOn 5 August 2019, it was announced that Messi would miss Barcelona\\'s US tour after sustaining a right calf injury.[262] On 19 August, Messi\\'s chipped goal from the edge of the box against Real Betis was nominated for the 2019 FIFA Puskás Award.[263] Later that month, he suffered another setback following the return of his calf injury, which ruled him out of the opening game of the season;[264] as a result, he was sidelined indefinitely, and was only expected to return to action with Barcelona after the September international break.[265] On 2 September, Messi was shortlisted as one of the three finalists for both the 2019 FIFA Puskás Award and the 2019 Best FIFA Men\\'s Player Award, with Messi winning the latter on 23 September.[266][267]\\nMessi made his first appearance of the season on 17 September, and on 6 October he scored his first goal of the season with a free kick in a 4–0 home win over Sevilla; this was his 420th goal in La Liga, which saw him break Cristiano Ronaldo\\'s record of 419 goals scored in Europe\\'s top five leagues.[268] On 23 October, Messi scored his first Champions League goal of the season in a 2–1 away win over Slavia Prague, becoming the first player to score in 15 consecutive Champions League seasons (excluding qualifying rounds).[269] He also equalled Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo\\'s shared record of the most sides scored against in the competition (33).[270] On 29 October, Messi scored in a 5–1 home win over Real Valladolid in La Liga; his first goal – a set piece from 35 yards – was the 50th free-kick of his career.[271] His goals (608) also saw him overtake Cristiano Ronaldo\\'s senior goal tally (606) at club level.[272] On 9 November, Messi scored three goals (including two free kicks) in a 4–1 home win against Celta Vigo. This was his 34th hat-trick in La Liga, equalling Cristiano Ronaldo\\'s Spanish top-flight record.[273] On 27 November, in what was his 700th appearance for Barcelona, Messi scored one goal and assisted two more in a 3–1 home win over Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League. Dortmund were the 34th team he had scored against in the competition, breaking the previous record of 33 held by Cristiano Ronaldo and Raúl.[274] On 2 December, Messi was awarded a record-breaking sixth Ballon d\\'Or.[275] On 8 December, Messi scored his record-breaking 35th hat-trick in La Liga with three goals in Barcelona\\'s 5–2 home win over Mallorca.[276]\\nOn 22 February 2020, Messi scored four goals in a 5–0 home win over Eibar in La Liga.[277] On 14 June, he scored in a 4–0 away win against Mallorca, becoming the first player ever in La Liga to score 20 goals or more in 12 consecutive seasons.[278] On 30 June, he scored a panenka in a 2–2 home draw against Atlético Madrid in La Liga, to reach his 700th goal in his senior career for Barcelona and Argentina.[279] On 11 July, Messi provided his 20th assist of the league season for Arturo Vidal in a 1–0 away win over Real Valladolid, equalling Xavi\\'s record of 20 assists in a single La Liga season from 2008 to 2009;[280][281] with 22 goals, he also became only the second player ever, after Thierry Henry in the 2002–03 FA Premier League season with Arsenal (24 goals and 20 assists), to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single league season in one of Europe\\'s top–five leagues.[281][282] Following his brace in a 5–0 away win against Alavés in the final match of the season on 20 May, Messi finished the season as both the top–scorer and top assist provider in La Liga, with 25 goals and 21 assists respectively, which saw him win his record seventh Pichichi trophy, overtaking Zarra; however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid.[283] On 9 August, in the Champions League round of 16 second leg versus Napoli at the Camp Nou, Messi scored the second goal and earned a penalty which led to a third goal and led his side to a 3–1 home victory and qualified 4–2 on aggregate for the quarter-finals against Bayern Munich.[284] On 15 August, Messi suffered his worst defeat as a player as Bayern Munich beat Barcelona 8–2 in a one-off tie in Lisbon, leading to another disappointing exit from the Champions League.[285]\\n“I wasn\\'t happy and I wanted to leave. I have not been allowed this in any way and I will stay at the club so as not to get into a legal dispute. The management of the club led by Bartomeu is a disaster. My love for Barca will never change.\"\\n– Messi on reversing his decision to leave Barcelona in an interview with Goal on 4 September 2020.[286]\\nFollowing growing dissatisfaction with the direction of Barcelona on and off the field,[287] Barcelona announced that Messi sent the club \"a document expressing his desire to leave\" on 25 August 2020.[288] The announcement garnered a significant media response, including from current and former teammates (who supported Messi\\'s statement) and Catalan president Quim Torra.[289] On 26 August, Barcelona\\'s sporting director Ramon Planes iterated the club\\'s desire to \"build a team around the most important player in the world\"[290] and affirmed Messi will only be able to leave should a buyer pay his €700 million buyout clause; a reported early termination option available in Messi\\'s contract (which would have allowed him to leave the club for free) could only be exercised if he had communicated his decision to Barcelona by 31 May 2020, although the player\\'s representatives argued the deadline should be set to 31 August, due to the adjourned 2019–20 season.[291] On 30 August, La Liga issued a statement stating Messi\\'s contract and buyout clause are still active.[292]\\nOn 4 September, Jorge Messi, Lionel\\'s father and agent, released a statement in response to La Liga claiming the release clause \"is not valid when the termination of the contract is by the player\\'s unilateral decision from the end of the 2019–20 season\", as stated in Messi\\'s contract with Barcelona;[293] moments later, La Liga issued a response reiterating their statement published on 30 August.[294] Later that evening, Messi announced in an interview with Goal that he would continue at Barcelona for the final year of his contract. In the interview, Messi claimed to have informed Barcelona of his desire to leave multiple times, and club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said Messi could decide at the end of every season if he wanted to stay or leave, only for Bartomeu to refer to the release clause.[295] This left Messi with two options: to stay or go to court against the club, with the player saying \"I would never go to court against the club of my life\".[296]\\nOn 27 September, Messi began the 2020–21 season by scoring a penalty in a 4–0 home win against Villarreal in La Liga.[297] Two days prior to the opening game, he again criticised the club, this time for the manner of Luis Suárez\\'s departure, stating, \"at this stage nothing surprises me any more\".[298] On 20 October, Messi scored a penalty in a 5–1 home victory against Ferencváros in the Champions League, becoming the first player in history to score in sixteen consecutive Champions League seasons.[299] On 25 November, Messi was nominated for the 2020 Best FIFA Men\\'s Player award, and was later shortlisted as one of the final three candidates.[300][301] On 29 November, Messi scored his side\\'s fourth goal in their 4–0 victory over Osasuna. After scoring, he unveiled a shirt of his former side Newell\\'s Old Boys, in tribute to Argentine compatriot Diego Maradona, who had died four days earlier, and raised both hands to the screen showing Maradona\\'s face in the stadium. The shirt was a number 10 replica of the same one Maradona had worn during his stint with the club in 1993.[302] On 17 December, Messi finished third in The Best FIFA Men\\'s Player award behind Robert Lewandowski and Cristiano Ronaldo, and was included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for the fourteenth consecutive year.[303]\\nOn 23 December, Messi scored his 644th goal for Barcelona against Real Valladolid in La Liga, surpassing Pelé with Santos as the player with the most goals scored for a single club.[304][305] In order to celebrate his achievement, Budweiser sent personalised bottles of beer to every goalkeeper whom Messi has scored against.[306] On 17 January 2021, Messi was sent off for the first time in his club career for violent conduct (swinging an arm at the head of Asier Villalibre, missed initially by the referee but reviewed via VAR) in the final minutes of Barcelona\\'s 2–3 extra time defeat to Athletic Bilbao in the 2020–21 Supercopa de España Final.[307] On 10 March, Messi scored from 35 yards out and later had a penalty saved in a 1–1 draw against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 as Barcelona were eliminated at this stage for the first time in 14 years by an aggregate score of 2–5 after having lost 1–4 at home on 16 February, with Messi scoring Barcelona\\'s only goal in that game.[308] On 15 March, Messi scored two goals in a 4–1 win against Huesca. With the first goal, he became the first player in football history to score at least 20 goals in 13 consecutive seasons in the top 5 European leagues.[309] On 21 March, he surpassed Xavi\\'s record to reach a club record of 768 appearances, in which he also scored a brace in a 6–1 away win against Real Sociedad.[310] On 17 April, Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the 2021 Copa del Rey Final. With his second goal, he broke Gerd Müller\\'s record of 30 plus goals in 12 consecutive club seasons, setting a new record of 13. With his 35th trophy with Barcelona, Messi also overtook former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs as the most decorated footballer for a single club.[311][312] On 16 May, Messi scored his 30th league goal of the campaign in a 1–2 home defeat against Celta Vigo, which later turned out to be his final goal and match in a Barcelona shirt.[313]\\nThe top goalscorer in La Liga, Messi was announced as the winner of the Pichichi trophy for a record eighth time in his career.[314] It was also his record fifth consecutive win in La Liga, surpassing Alfredo Di Stéfano and Hugo Sánchez who both had four for Real Madrid,[314] and equalled former Marseille striker Jean-Pierre Papin\\'s record of five consecutive league top scorer awards in the top five leagues of Europe.\\n\"Leo wanted to stay and the Club wanted him to stay but with the La Liga rules it has not been possible. To comply with the league\\'s fair play regulations we had to accept an agreement that mortgaged the Club\\'s TV right for half a century and FC Barcelona is above everything else.\"\\n– Barcelona president Joan Laporta explains the reason behind Messi\\'s departure.[315]\\nOn 1 July, Messi became a free agent after his contract expired,[316] with negotiations on a new deal complicated due to financial issues at Barcelona.[317] On 5 August, Barcelona announced that Messi would not be staying at the club, even though both parties reached an agreement and were due to sign a contract that day. The club cited financial and structural obstacles posed by La Liga regulations as a reason for Messi\\'s departure.[318] Club president Joan Laporta also blamed the previous board for Messi\\'s exit by saying \"the basis of everything is the calamitous and disastrous situation left by the previous board\", he added by saying \"the expected debt is much higher and we had some sports contracts in place that meant we had no margin on salary\".[319] Three days later, in a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed that he would be leaving Barcelona.[320]\\nOn 10 August, Messi joined French club Paris Saint-Germain.[321] He signed a two-year deal until June 2023 with an option for an extra year.[322] Messi chose 30 as his squad number, the same he wore as a teenager when he made his senior debut for Barcelona.[323]\\nMessi made his debut for the club on 29 August, coming on as a substitute in the second half of a 2–0 away win over Reims in Ligue 1.[324] He made his first start and UEFA Champions League debut for the club in a 1–1 away draw against Club Brugge on 15 September.[325] Four days later, Messi made his home debut for PSG in a 2–1 win over Lyon.[326] On 28 September, Messi scored his first goal for the club, a strike from the edge of the 18-yard box after playing a one-two with Kylian Mbappé, in a 2–0 Champions League group stage win over Pep Guardiola\\'s Manchester City.[327] On 21 November, Messi scored his first Ligue 1 goal in a 3–1 home victory over Nantes.[328] On 28 November, Messi provided a hat-trick of assists for the fifth time in his career as PSG beat Saint-Étienne 3–1 away from home.[329]\\nHaving scored 40 goals at club and international level for the calendar year and helped Argentina win the 2021 Copa América, Messi received a record seventh Ballon d\\'Or on 29 November.[330]\\nAs a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.[331] Selectors for Spain\\'s Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona\\'s director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.[332]\\nAware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad\\'s senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina\\'s fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals.[333][334] His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the title in 1979.[334]\\nIn recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision.[335] Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off.[336] He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his \"re-debut\" ahead of the match.[337] Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as \"a jewel\".[338] He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina\\'s participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006.[339] A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for Pékerman\\'s squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.[340]\\nDuring the World Cup in Germany, Messi witnessed their opening match victory against the Ivory Coast from the substitutes\\' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[341] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0–0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[342][343] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed.[344][345] He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4–2 in a penalty shootout.[346] Back home, Pékerman\\'s decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina\\'s favour.[347][348]\\nAs Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile\\'s starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela.[61][349] He set up the game-winning goal of their 4–1 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against Colombia.[350][351] At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico\\'s goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win.[349] In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a Brazil squad that lacked several of the nation\\'s best players.[352] Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Román Riquelme.[349] He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.[353]\\nAhead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.[354] After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista\\'s under-23 squad in Beijing.[355] During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1–0 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time. After a 3–0 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals.[356] Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament\\'s best team.[357]\\nFrom late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances.[349] Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which included playing Messi out of his usual position. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona\\'s stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela.[339][358] During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina\\'s number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.[359] Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process.[339] Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.[360]\\nDespite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by Nigeria\\'s goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side\\'s 4–1 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched.[358] He wore the captain\\'s armband for the first time in their 2–0 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.[361]\\nArgentina were eliminated in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 4–0 loss was their worst margin of defeat at a World Cup since 1974.[362] FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament\\'s 10 best players, citing his \"outstanding\" pace and creativity and \"spectacular and efficient\" dribbling, shooting and passing.[363] Back home, however, Messi was the subject of harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.[364]\\nMaradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina\\'s Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a false nine within a 4–3–3 system, as used to much success by Barcelona.[364][365] Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010–11 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009.[113][339] Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the 2011 Copa América, hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker Carlos Tevez, who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team\\'s supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3–0 victory over Costa Rica. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 1–1 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 4–5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.[364]\\nAfter Argentina\\'s unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team\\'s on-field leader and motivator.[366][367] In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.[339][366]\\nUnder Sabella, Messi\\'s goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years.[339][366] He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.[368] His first international hat-trick came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina\\'s second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign.[339][369] Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.[366]\\nAhead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi\\'s form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At the start of the tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches.[370] In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2–1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create Sead Kolašinac\\'s own goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier.[371] During the second match against Iran, he scored an injury-time goal from 25 yards out to end the game in a 1–0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase.[372] He scored twice in the last group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group.[373] Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1–0 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.[374][375] Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team\\'s first penalty.[376]\\nBilled as Messi versus Germany, the world\\'s best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona.[377] Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular at the start of the second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario Götze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1–0 to claim the World Cup.[378] At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition.[370][379] However, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing purposes.[380]\\nAnother final appearance, the third of Messi\\'s senior international career, followed in the 2015 Copa América, held in Chile. Under the stewardship of former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, Argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the World Cup.[381][382] During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2–2 draw; Messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament.[383] Following a 1–0 win against defending champions Uruguay, Messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1–0 win over Jamaica, becoming only the fifth Argentine to achieve this milestone.[384] In his 100 appearances, he had scored a total of 46 goals for Argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.[339][384]\\nAs Messi evolved from the team\\'s symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners.[385] In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia\\'s goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5–4 penalty shootout in their favour, with Messi netting his team\\'s first spot kick.[386] At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as a playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side\\'s 6–1 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd.[385] Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout after an 0–0 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty.[387] At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour.[388] As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa América defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.[389]\\nMessi\\'s place in Argentina\\'s Copa América Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1–0 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa América warm-up match on 27 May 2016.[390] It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina\\'s 2–1 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness.[391] Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation\\'s second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernández in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agüero\\'s goal, as the match ended in a 5–0 victory, sealing Argentina\\'s place in the quarter-finals of the competition;[392] he was elected man of the match for his performance.[393]\\n\"Did it annoy me that Messi took the record? A little, yes. You go around the world and people say, \\'he\\'s the top scorer for the Argentina national team.\\' But the advantage I have is that I\\'m second to an extraterrestrial.\"\\n– Gabriel Batistuta on the consolation of Messi breaking his record.[394]\\nOn 18 June, in the quarter-final of the Copa América against Venezuela, Messi produced another man of the match performance,[395] assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4–1 victory, which enabled him to equal Gabriel Batistuta\\'s national record of 54 goals in official international matches.[396] This record was broken three days later when Messi scored a free kick in a 4–0 semi-final win against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year,[397] and was named man of the match once again.[398]\\nDuring a repeat of the previous year\\'s final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi\\'s third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football.[399] He stated, \"I tried my hardest. The team has ended for me, a decision made.\"[400] Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, \"My generation can\\'t compare him to Maradona that\\'s for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States.\"[401] Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3);[402] he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.[403]\\nFollowing his announcement, a campaign began in Argentina for Messi to change his mind about retiring.[404] He was greeted by fans with signs like \"Don\\'t go, Leo\" when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, \"We are lucky, it is one of life\\'s pleasures, it is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him.\"[405] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement.[406] The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.[407]\\n\"A lot of things went through my mind on the night of the final and I gave serious thought to quitting, but my love for my country and this shirt is too great.\"\\n– Messi reversing his decision from retiring on 12 August 2016[408]\\nJust a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper La Nación reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September.[409] On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team\\'s upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers.[410] On 1 September, in his first game back, he scored in a 1–0 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.[411]\\nOn 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000.[412][413] On 5 May, Messi\\'s four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina\\'s remaining World Cup Qualifiers.[414] Argentina\\'s place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3–1 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001.[415] Messi\\'s three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay\\'s Luis Suárez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hernán Crespo.[415]\\n\"The squad is the worst in their history. Even having the best player in the world was not capable of creating a competitive team. All the decline of recent times was hidden by this unrivalled genius [Messi]\"\\n– Former Argentine player Osvaldo Ardiles on the decline in quality of Argentina being masked by Messi.[416]\\nFollowing on from their poor qualification campaign, expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team, without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018.[417][418] Prior to Argentina\\'s opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this would be Messi\\'s final World Cup.[419] In the team\\'s opening group match against Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw.[420] In Argentina\\'s second game on 21 June, the team lost 3–0 to Croatia. Post-match the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding Messi, saying \"we quite simply couldn\\'t pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to. We worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. We lost that battle\".[421] Croatia captain and midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match, \"Messi is an incredible player but he can\\'t do everything alone.\"[422]\\nIn Argentina\\'s final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties.[423] A goal of the tournament contender, Messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot.[424][425] He was later awarded Man of the Match.[426] Argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind Croatia.[427] In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado\\'s and Sergio Agüero\\'s goals in a 3–4 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup.[428] With his two assists in his team\\'s second round fixture, Messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last four World Cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a match for Argentina since Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.[429][430]\\nFollowing the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in Argentina\\'s friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September, and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for the remainder of the calendar year. Messi\\'s absence from the national team and his continued failure to win a title with Argentina prompted speculation in the media that Messi might retire from international football once again.[431] In March 2019, however, he was called up to the Argentina squad once again for the team\\'s friendlies against Venezuela and Morocco later that month.[432] He made his international return on 22 March, in a 3–1 friendly defeat to Venezuela, in Madrid.[433]\\nOn 21 May, Messi was included in Lionel Scaloni\\'s final 23-man Argentina squad for the 2019 Copa América.[434] In Argentina\\'s second group match of the tournament on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1–1 draw against Paraguay.[435] After coming under criticism in the media over his performance following Argentina\\'s 2–0 victory over Venezuela in the quarter-finals at the Maracanã Stadium on 28 June, Messi commented that it had not been his best Copa América, while also criticising the poor quality of the pitches.[436] Following Argentina\\'s 2–0 defeat to hosts Brazil in the semi-finals on 2 July, Messi was critical of the refereeing during the match,[437][438] and alleged the competition was \"setup\" for Brazil to win.[439] In the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Agüero\\'s opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2–1 win, to help Argentina capture the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean defender.[440] Following the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off.[441] Messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina\\'s next World Cup qualifier.[442] On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee\\'s decisions; this ban meant he would miss Argentina\\'s friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and October.[443] On 15 November, Messi played in the 2019 Superclásico de las Américas versus Brazil, scoring the winning goal by a rebound of his saved penalty.[444] On 8 October 2020, Messi scored a penalty in a 1–0 victory against Ecuador, giving Argentina a winning start to their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign.[445]\\n\"It was clear to me that I had to try until the last tournament and that I couldn\\'t withdraw from the national team without winning something.\"\\n– Messi on winning the 2021 Copa América in an interview with Diario SPORT.[446]\\nOn 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina\\'s opening group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil.[447] On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as he equalled Javier Mascherano\\'s record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1–0 win over Paraguay in their third game of the tournament.[448] A week later, he broke the record for most appearances in an Argentina shirt when he featured in a 4–1 win against Bolivia in his team\\'s final group match, assisting Papu Gómez\\'s opening goal and later scoring two.[449] On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored from a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition.[450] On 6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later netted his spot kick in Argentina\\'s eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth international final.[451][452] On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts Brazil 1–0 in the final, giving Messi his first major international title and Argentina\\'s first since 1993, as well as his nation\\'s joint record 15th Copa América overall.[453] Messi was directly involved in 9 out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player of the tournament for his performances, an honour he shared with Neymar. He also finished as the tournament\\'s top scorer with four goals tied with Colombia\\'s Luis Díaz, with the Golden Boot awarded to Messi as he had more assists.[454][455]\\nOn 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pelé as South America\\'s top male international scorer with 79 goals.[456]\\nDue to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;[457][458] this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica (\"The Atomic Flea\").[459][460][461] Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.[17][458][462] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.[463] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \"Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.\"[46] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[464][465]\\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[466] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[467][468][469] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[458][470] As of August 2021, Messi ranks 11th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 58,[471] the most among active players.[472] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[473]\\nMessi\\'s pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch.[462][470][474] Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world,[475] and one of the greatest dribblers of all time,[476] with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, \"The ball stays glued to his foot; I\\'ve seen great players in my career, but I\\'ve never seen anyone with Messi\\'s ball control.\"[465] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.[457][458]\\nTactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.[360] Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates.[46] Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates\\' attacking runs off the ball, Messi\\'s own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.[24] Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager\\'s 4–3–3 formation,[174][477] while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons.[478][479] Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box,[480] or even on the right wing[481] or as a false nine,[482][483] he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1,[479] or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his teams attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Suárez.[484][485]\\nAs his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history.[486][487][488] His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule.[489] With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.[365][490]\\n\"I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi.\"\\n– Diego Maradona hailing the 18-year-old Messi as his successor in February 2006[68]\\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world\\'s best players before age 20.[61] Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the Ballon d\\'Or, commented, \"I\\'m not even the best at Barça\", in reference to his protégé.[491][492] Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d\\'Or by a record margin,[75] the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history.[13][462][493] An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.[494] In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players,[115][495] and by the end of Barça\\'s second treble-winning season, Messi\\'s superiority, ahead of Maradona and Pelé, had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe.[496][497] He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina,[498] until he won his first international trophy at the 2021 Copa América.[499]\\n.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle .thumbcaption{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow>.thumbcaption{text-align:center}}Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the \"New Maradona\" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona.[21][358] Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, \"Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.\"[500] César Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays \"at the level of the best Maradona\".[501] Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.[502][503][504]\\nIn Argentine society, Messi is generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football.[331][505][506] An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age,[17][331] while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (he does not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine.[364] Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: \"Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.\"[507] Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, have also questioned Messi\\'s leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.[508][509][510]\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[511][512]\\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[513][514] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world:[160] since 2008, Messi has won seven Ballons d\\'Or to Ronaldo\\'s five,[515] six FIFA World\\'s Best Player awards to Ronaldo\\'s five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo\\'s four.[516] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players;[160][517] beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}1.87\\xa0m (6\\xa0ft 1+1⁄2\\xa0in) with a muscular build – and contrasting public personalities, with Ronaldo\\'s self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi\\'s humility.[518][519][520] From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world\\'s most viewed annual sports events.[521] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.[521]\\nAccording to France Football, Messi was the world\\'s highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40\\xa0million benchmark, with earnings of €41\\xa0million in 2013, and the €50–€60\\xa0million points, with income of €65\\xa0million in 2014.[165][522] Messi was second on Forbes list of the world\\'s highest-paid athletes (after Cristiano Ronaldo) with income of $81.4\\xa0million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[523] In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the €100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of €126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements.[524] Forbes ranked him the world\\'s highest-paid athlete in 2019.[525] From 2008, he was Barcelona\\'s highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8\\xa0million to €13\\xa0million over the next five years.[81][82][146] Signing a new Barcelona contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona also paid him $59.6\\xa0million as a signing on bonus.[526] His buyout clause was set at $835\\xa0million (€700\\xa0million).[526] In 2020, Messi became the second footballer (and second athlete in a team sport), after Cristiano Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.[527]\\nIn addition to his salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world\\'s most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010.[528] His main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas. As Barcelona\\'s leading youth prospect, he had been signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival\\'s claim to his image rights in court.[529] Over time, Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser;[521] from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi.[530][531] Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz.[532] In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi\\'s name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide.[533]\\nAs a commercial entity, Messi\\'s marketing brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami.[535][536] From 2010 onwards, concurrently with his increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet.[535][537] Messi is also a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies.[538][539][540][541] Additionally, Messi was the face of Konami\\'s video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and has since appeared on four consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.[542][543]\\nMessi\\'s global popularity and influence are well documented. He was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world\\'s most influential people as published by Time, in 2011 and 2012.[544][545] His fanbase on the social media website Facebook is among the largest of all public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi\\'s Facebook page had nearly seven\\xa0million followers, and by August 2021 he had over 103\\xa0million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[546][547] He also has over 280 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[548] According to a 2014 survey by sports research firm Repucom in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players.[549][550] On Messi\\'s economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \"tourist attraction\".[551]\\nOther events have illustrated Messi\\'s presence in popular culture. A solid gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25\\xa0kg (55\\xa0lb) and valued at $5.25\\xa0million, went on sale in Japan in March 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[552] A 2013 Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with then-Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in the year of its release, receiving 137\\xa0million views, and was subsequently voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube\\'s founding.[553][554] World Press Photo selected \"The Final Game\", a photograph of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina\\'s final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.[555] Messi, a documentary about his life by filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.[556]\\nIn June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, \"sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.\"[557]\\nSince 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario.[558] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[559] After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.\\n\"Leo is not shy. He\\'s introverted. He\\'s reserved.\"\\n— Endocrinologist Diego Schwarzstein,[note 4] who addressed Messi\\'s growth hormone deficiency from 1997 to 2001.\\nMessi and Roccuzzo have three sons: Thiago (born 2012), Mateo (born 2015) and Ciro (born 2018). To celebrate his partner\\'s first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina\\'s 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[561] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012, with Messi attending the birth after being given permission by Barcelona to miss training.[562] Thiago\\'s name and handprints are tattooed on his left calf.[149] In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[563] He missed training ahead of a match against Atlético Madrid to attend the birth of his second son, Mateo, on 11 September 2015 in Barcelona.[564] On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario with about 260 guests attending his wedding.[565] On 15 October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.[566] On 10 March 2018, Messi skipped the match against Málaga after Ciro was born.[567]\\nMessi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.[568]\\nSince leaving for Spain at age 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family\\'s old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \"The Machine of \\'87\" at Newell\\'s Old Boys. He currently lives in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. Although considered a one-club man, he has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell\\'s. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell\\'s embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.[17][569][570]\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children\\'s Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.[571][572] Messi has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country\\'s children in the wake of the recent earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[573] To celebrate his son\\'s first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[574]\\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[575] It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.[569] Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.[569][576] In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \"Messi and Friends\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.[577][578]\\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell\\'s Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[569] At Newell\\'s Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club\\'s stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell\\'s, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[17] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières.[579] Messi made a donation worth €1\\xa0million ($1.1\\xa0million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[580] This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina.[581] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[582]\\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team\\'s security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[583][584] In February 2021, Messi donated his Adidas shoes to the Museu Nacional d\\'Art de Catalunya which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé\\'s record for most goals scored for a single club, the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.[585]\\nIn advance of the 2021 Copa América in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech—whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi—in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac\\'s COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America\\'s football players.[586] A deal brokered by Uruguay\\'s president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones in Uruguay remarking that \"Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones\".[586]\\nMessi\\'s financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1\\xa0million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1\\xa0million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7\\xa0million and €1.4\\xa0million in fines.[587] Facing the judge, he said, \"I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.\"[588]\\nBarcelona[599]\\nArgentina U20\\nArgentina U23\\nArgentina\\nIndividual\\nBibliography\\n'"

              "'\\nArgentine professional footballer\\nEponym\\nFilms\\nFamily\\nRelated\\nDiego Armando Maradona (Spanish:\\xa0[ˈdjeɣo maɾaˈðona]; 30 October 1960\\xa0– 25 November 2020) was an Argentine professional football player and manager. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award.[3][4] Maradona\\'s vision, passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature, which gave him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most other players. His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team\\'s general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. In addition to his creative abilities, he possessed an eye for goal and was known to be a free kick specialist. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname \"El Pibe de Oro\" (\"The Golden Boy\"), a name that stuck with him throughout his career.[5] He also had a troubled off-field life and was banned in both 1991 and 1994 for abusing drugs.[6]\\nAn advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position, Maradona was the first player to set the world record transfer fee twice: in 1982 when he transferred to Barcelona for £5\\xa0million, and in 1984 when he moved to Napoli for a fee of £6.9\\xa0million.[7] He played for Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla, and Newell\\'s Old Boys during his club career, and is most famous for his time at Napoli where he won numerous accolades.\\nIn his international career with Argentina, he earned 91 caps and scored 34 goals. Maradona played in four FIFA World Cups, including the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, where he captained Argentina and led them to victory over West Germany in the final, and won the Golden Ball as the tournament\\'s best player. In the 1986 World Cup quarter final, he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory over England that entered football history for two different reasons. The first goal was an unpenalized handling foul known as the \"Hand of God\", while the second goal followed a 60\\xa0m (66\\xa0yd) dribble past five England players, voted \"Goal of the Century\" by FIFA.com voters in 2002.[8]\\nMaradona became the coach of Argentina\\'s national football team in November 2008. He was in charge of the team at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa before leaving at the end of the tournament. He then coached Dubai-based club Al Wasl in the UAE Pro-League for the 2011–12 season. In 2017, Maradona became the coach of Fujairah before leaving at the end of the season.[9] In May 2018, Maradona was announced as the new chairman of Belarusian club Dynamo Brest.[10] He arrived in Brest and was presented by the club to start his duties in July.[11] From September 2018 to June 2019, Maradona was coach of Mexican club Dorados.[12] He was the coach of Argentine Primera División club Gimnasia de La Plata from September 2019 until his death in November 2020.[13]\\nDiego Armando Maradona was born on 30 October 1960, at the Policlínico (Polyclinic) Evita Hospital in Lanús, Buenos Aires Province to a poor family that had moved from Corrientes Province; he was raised in Villa Fiorito, a shantytown on the southern outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina.[14] He was the first son after four daughters. He has two younger brothers, Hugo (el Turco) and Raúl (Lalo), both of whom were also professional football players. His father Diego Maradona \"Chitoro\" (1927–2015), who worked at a chemicals factory, was of Guaraní (Indigenous) and Spanish (Basque) descent, and his mother Dalma Salvadora Franco, \"Doña Tota\" (1930–2011), was of Italian descent.[15]\\nWhen Diego came to Argentinos Juniors for trials, I was really struck by his talent and couldn\\'t believe he was only eight years old. In fact, we asked him for his ID card so we could check it, but he told us he didn\\'t have it on him. We were sure he was having us on because, although he had the physique of a child, he played like an adult. When we discovered he\\'d been telling us the truth, we decided to devote ourselves purely to him.Maradona\\'s parents were both born and brought up in the town of Esquina in the north-east province of Corrientes, living only two hundred metres from each other on the banks of the Corriente River. In 1950, they left Esquina and settled in Buenos Aires. Maradona received his first football as a gift at age three and quickly became devoted to the game.[17] At age eight, Maradona was spotted by a talent scout while he was playing in his neighbourhood club Estrella Roja. He became a staple of Los Cebollitas (The Little Onions), the junior team of Buenos Aires\\'s Argentinos Juniors. As a 12-year-old ball boy, he amused spectators by showing his wizardry with the ball during the halftime intermissions of first division games.[18] He named Brazilian playmaker Rivellino and Manchester United winger George Best among his inspirations growing up.[19][20]\\nOn 20 October 1976, Maradona made his professional debut for Argentinos Juniors, 10 days before his 16th birthday,[21] vs. Talleres de Córdoba. He entered to the pitch wearing the number 16 jersey, and became the youngest player in the history of the Argentine Primera División. A few minutes after debuting, Maradona kicked the ball through Juan Domingo Cabrera\\'s legs, making a nutmeg that would become legendary.[22] After the game, Maradona said, \"That day I felt I had held the sky in my hands.\"[23] Thirty years later, Cabrera remembered Maradona\\'s debut: \"I was on the right side of the field and went to press him, but he didn\\'t give me a chance. He made the nutmeg and when I turned around, he was far away from me\".[24] Maradona scored his first goal in the Primera División against Marplatense team San Lorenzo on 14 November 1976, two weeks after turning 16.[25]\\nMaradona spent five years at Argentinos Juniors, from 1976 to 1981, scoring 115 goals in 167 appearances before his US$\\xa04\\xa0million transfer to Boca Juniors.[26] Maradona received offers to join other clubs, including River Plate who offered to make him the club\\'s best paid player.[27] However, River decided to drop its bid due to its large payroll in keeping Daniel Passarella and Ubaldo Fillol.[28]\\nMaradona signed a contract with Boca Juniors on 20 February 1981. He made his debut two days later against Talleres de Córdoba, scoring twice in the club\\'s 4–1 win. On 10 April, Maradona played his first Superclásico against River Plate at La Bombonera stadium. Boca defeated River 3–0 with Maradona scoring a goal after dribbling past Alberto Tarantini and Fillol.[29] Despite the distrustful relationship between Maradona and Boca Juniors manager, Silvio Marzolini,[30] Boca had a successful season, winning the league title after securing a point against Racing Club.[31] That would be the only title won by Maradona in the Argentine domestic league.[32]\\n\"He had complete mastery of the ball. When Maradona ran with the ball or dribbled through the defence, he seemed to have the ball tied to his boots. I remember our early training sessions with him: the rest of the team were so amazed that they just stood and watched him. We all thought ourselves privileged to be witnesses of his genius.\"\\n—Barcelona teammate Lobo Carrasco[33]\\nAfter the 1982 World Cup, in June, Maradona was transferred to Barcelona in Spain for a then world record fee of £5\\xa0million ($7.6\\xa0million).[34] In 1983, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona and Maradona won the Copa del Rey (Spain\\'s annual national cup competition), beating Real Madrid, and the Spanish Super Cup, beating Athletic Bilbao. On 26 June 1983, Barcelona won away to Real Madrid in one of the world\\'s biggest club games, El Clásico, a match where Maradona scored and became the first Barcelona player to be applauded by arch-rival Real Madrid fans.[35] Maradona dribbled past Madrid goalkeeper Agustín, and as he approached the empty goal, he stopped just as Madrid defender Juan José came sliding in an attempt to block the shot. José ended up crashing into the post, before Maradona slotted the ball into the net.[36] With the manner in which the goal was scored resulting in applause from opposition fans, only Ronaldinho (in November 2005) and Andrés Iniesta (in November 2015) have since been granted such an ovation as Barcelona players from Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu.[35][37]\\nDue to illness and injury as well as controversial incidents on the field, Maradona had a difficult tenure in Barcelona.[38] First a bout of hepatitis, then a broken ankle in a La Liga game at the Camp Nou in September 1983 caused by a reckless tackle by Athletic Bilbao\\'s Andoni Goikoetxea—nicknamed \"the Butcher of Bilbao\"—threatened to jeopardize Maradona\\'s career, but with treatment and rehabilitation, it was possible for him to return to the pitch after a three-month recovery period.[21][39]\\nMaradona was directly involved in a violent and chaotic fight  at the 1984 Copa del Rey Final at the Santiago Bernabéu stadium in Madrid against Athletic Bilbao.[40] After receiving another hard tackle by Goikoetxea, as well as being taunted with racist insults related to his father\\'s Native American ancestry throughout the match by Bilbao fans, and being provoked by Bilbao\\'s Miguel Sola at full time after Barcelona lost 1–0, Maradona snapped.[40] He aggressively got up, stood inches from Sola\\'s face and the two exchanged words. This started a chain reaction of emotional reactions from both teams. Using expletives, Sola mimicked a gesture from the crowd towards Maradona by using a xenophobic term.[41] Maradona then headbutted Sola, elbowed another Bilbao player in the face and kneed another player in the head, knocking him out cold.[40] The Bilbao squad surrounded Maradona to exact some retribution, with Goikoetxea connecting with a high kick to his chest, before the rest of the Barcelona squad joined in to help Maradona. From this point, Barcelona and Bilbao players brawled on the field with Maradona in the centre of the action, kicking and punching anyone in a Bilbao shirt.[40]\\nThe mass brawl was played out in front of the Spanish King Juan Carlos and an audience of 100,000 fans inside the stadium, and more than half of Spain watching on television.[42] After fans began throwing solid objects on the field at the players, coaches and even photographers, sixty people were injured, with the incident effectively sealing Maradona\\'s transfer out of the club in what was his last game in a Barcelona shirt.[41] One Barcelona executive stated, \"When I saw those scenes of Maradona fighting and the chaos that followed I realized we couldn\\'t go any further with him.\"[42] Maradona got into frequent disputes with FC Barcelona executives, particularly club president Josep Lluís Núñez, culminating with a demand to be transferred out of Camp Nou in 1984. During his two injury-hit seasons at Barcelona, Maradona scored 38 goals in 58 games.[43] Maradona transferred to Napoli in Italy\\'s Serie A for another world record fee, £6.9\\xa0million ($10.48\\xa0million).[7]\\nMaradona arrived in Naples and was presented to the world media as a Napoli player on 5 July 1984, where he was welcomed by 75,000 fans at his presentation at the Stadio San Paolo.[44] Sports writer David Goldblatt commented, \"They [the fans] were convinced that the saviour had arrived.\"[45] A local newspaper stated that despite the lack of a \"mayor, houses, schools, buses, employment and sanitation, none of this matters because we have Maradona\".[45] Prior to Maradona\\'s arrival, Italian football was dominated by teams from the north and centre of the country, such as A.C. Milan, Juventus, Inter Milan, and Roma, and no team in the south of the Italian Peninsula had ever won a league title. This was perhaps the perfect scenario for the Maradona and his working-class-sympathetic image, as he joined a once-great team that was facing relegation at the end of the 1983-84 Serie A season, in what was the toughest and most highly regarded football league in Europe.[45][46]\\nAt Napoli, Maradona reached the peak of his professional career: he soon inherited the captain\\'s armband from Napoli veteran defender Giuseppe Bruscolotti[47] and quickly became an adored star among the club\\'s fans; in his time there he elevated the team to the most successful era in its history.[45] Maradona played for Napoli at a period when north–south tensions in Italy were at a peak due to a variety of issues, notably the economic differences between the two.[45] Led by Maradona, Napoli won their first ever Serie A Italian Championship in 1986–87.[45] Goldblatt wrote, \"The celebrations were tumultuous. A rolling series of impromptu street parties and festivities broke out contagiously across the city in a round-the-clock carnival which ran for over a week. The world was turned upside down. The Neapolitans held mock funerals for Juventus and Milan, burning their coffins, their death notices announcing \\'May 1987, the other Italy has been defeated. A new empire is born.\\'\"[45] Murals of Maradona were painted on the city\\'s ancient buildings, and newborn children were named in his honour.[45] The following season, the team\\'s prolific attacking trio, formed by Maradona, Bruno Giordano, and Careca, was later dubbed the \"Ma-Gi-Ca\" (magical) front-line.[48]\\nNapoli would win their second league title in 1989–90, and finish runners up in the league twice, in 1987–88 and 1988–89.[45] Other honours during the Maradona era at Napoli included the Coppa Italia in 1987 (as well as a second-place finish in the Coppa Italia in 1989), the UEFA Cup in 1989, and the Italian Supercup in 1990.[45] During the 1989 UEFA Cup Final against Stuttgart, Maradona scored from a penalty in a 2–1 home victory in the first leg, later assisting Careca\\'s match–winning goal,[49][50] while in the second leg on 17 May – a 3–3 away draw –, he assisted Ciro Ferrara\\'s goal with a header.[51][52] Despite primarily playing in a creative role as an attacking midfielder, Maradona was the top scorer in Serie A in 1987–88 with 15 goals, and was the all-time leading goalscorer for Napoli, with 115 goals,[53] until his record was broken by Marek Hamšík in 2017.[32][54][55] When asked who was the toughest player he ever faced, A.C. Milan central defender Franco Baresi stated it was Maradona, a view shared by his Milan teammate Paolo Maldini.[56][57]\\nAlthough Maradona was successful on the field during his time in Italy, his personal problems increased. His cocaine use continued, and he received US$70,000 in fines from his club for missing games and practices, ostensibly because of \"stress\".[58] He faced a scandal there regarding an illegitimate son, and he was also the object of some suspicion over an alleged friendship with the Camorra crime syndicate.[59][60][61][62] He also faced intense backlash and harassment from some local fans after the 1990 World Cup, in which he and Argentina beat Italy in a semi-final match- at the San Paolo stadium. In 2000, the number 10 jersey of Napoli was officially retired.[63] On 4 December 2020, nine days after Maradona\\'s death, Napoli\\'s home stadium was renamed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.[64]\\nAfter serving a 15-month ban for failing a drug test for cocaine, Maradona left Napoli in disgrace in 1992. Despite interest from Real Madrid and Marseille, he signed for Sevilla, where he stayed for one year.[65] In 1993, he played for Newell\\'s Old Boys and in 1995 returned to Boca Juniors for a two-year stint.[21] Maradona also appeared for Tottenham Hotspur in a testimonial match for Osvaldo Ardiles against Internazionale, shortly before the 1986 World Cup.[66] In 1996, he played in a friendly match alongside his brother Raul for Toronto Italia against the Canadian National Soccer League All-Stars.[67] Maradona was himself given a testimonial match in November 2001, played between an all-star World XI and the Argentina national team.[68]\\nDuring his time with the Argentina national team, Maradona scored 34 goals in 91 appearances. He made his full international debut at age 16, against Hungary, on 27 February 1977. Maradona was left off the Argentine squad for the 1978 World Cup on home soil by coach César Luis Menotti who felt he was too young at age 17.[69] At age 18, Maradona played the 1979 FIFA World Youth Championship in Japan and emerged as the star of the tournament, shining in Argentina\\'s 3–1 final win over the Soviet Union, scoring a total of six goals in six appearances in the tournament.[70] On 2 June 1979, Maradona scored his first senior international goal in a 3–1 win against Scotland at Hampden Park.[71] He went on to play for Argentina in two 1979 Copa América ties during August 1979, a 2–1 loss against Brazil and a 3–0 win over Bolivia in which he scored his side\\'s third goal.[72]\\nSpeaking thirty years later on the impact of Maradona\\'s performances in 1979, FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated, \"Everyone has an opinion on Diego Armando Maradona, and that’s been the case since his playing days. My most vivid recollection is of this incredibly gifted kid at the second FIFA U-20 World Cup in Japan in 1979. He left everyone open-mouthed every time he got on the ball.\"[73] Maradona and his compatriot Lionel Messi are the only players to win the Golden Ball at both the FIFA U-20 World Cup and FIFA World Cup. Maradona did so in 1979 and 1986, which Messi emulated in 2005 and 2014.[74]\\nMaradona played his first World Cup tournament in 1982 in his new country of residence, Spain. Argentina played Belgium in the opening game of the 1982 Cup at the Camp Nou in Barcelona. The Catalan crowd was eager to see their new world-record signing Maradona in action, but he did not perform to expectations,[75] as Argentina, the defending champions, lost 1–0. Although the team convincingly beat both Hungary and El Salvador in Alicante to progress to the second round, there were internal tensions within the team, with the younger, less experienced players at odds with the older, more experienced players. With a team that also included such players as Mario Kempes, Osvaldo Ardiles, Ramón Díaz, Daniel Bertoni, Alberto Tarantini, Ubaldo Fillol, and Daniel Passarella, the Argentine side was defeated in the second round by Brazil and by eventual winners Italy. The Italian match is renowned for Maradona being aggressively man-marked by Claudio Gentile, as Italy beat Argentina at the Sarrià Stadium in Barcelona, 2–1.[76]\\nMaradona played in all five matches without being substituted, scoring twice against Hungary. He was fouled repeatedly in all five games and particularly in the last one against Brazil at the Sarrià, a game that was blighted by poor officiating and violent fouls. With Argentina already down 3–0 to Brazil, Maradona\\'s temper eventually got the better of him and he was sent off with five minutes remaining for a serious retaliatory foul against Batista.[77]\\nMaradona captained the Argentine national team to victory in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, winning the final in Mexico City against West Germany.[78] Throughout the tournament, Maradona asserted his dominance and was the most dynamic player of the competition. He played every minute of every Argentina game, scoring five goals and making five assists, three of those in the opening match against South Korea at the Olímpico Universitario Stadium in Mexico City. His first goal of the tournament came against Italy in the second group game in Puebla.[79] Argentina eliminated Uruguay in the first knockout round in Puebla, setting up a match against England at the Azteca Stadium, also in Mexico City. After scoring two contrasting goals in the 2–1 quarter-final win against England, his legend was cemented.[39] The majesty of his second goal and the notoriety of his first led to the French newspaper L\\'Équipe describing Maradona as \"half-angel, half-devil\".[80] This match was played with the background of the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom.[81] Replays showed that the first goal was scored by striking the ball with his hand. Maradona was coyly evasive, describing it as \"a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God\".[78] It became known as the \"Hand of God\". Ultimately, on 22 August 2005, Maradona acknowledged on his television show that he had hit the ball with his hand purposely, and no contact with his head was made, and that he immediately knew the goal was illegitimate. This became known as an international fiasco in World Cup history. The goal stood, much to the wrath of the English players.[82]\\n\"Maradona, turns like a little eel and comes away from trouble, little squat man... comes inside Butcher and leaves him for dead, outside Fenwick and leaves him for dead, and puts the ball away... and that is why Maradona is the greatest player in the world.\"\\n—Bryon Butler\\'s BBC Radio commentary on Maradona\\'s second goal against England[83]\\nMaradona\\'s second goal, just four minutes after the hotly disputed hand-goal, was later voted by FIFA as the greatest goal in the history of the World Cup. He received the ball in his own half, swivelled around and with 11 touches ran more than half the length of the field, dribbling past five English outfield players (Peter Beardsley, Steve Hodge, Peter Reid, Terry Butcher, and Terry Fenwick) before he left goalkeeper Peter Shilton on his backside with a feint, and slotted the ball into the net.[84] This goal was voted \"Goal of the Century\" in a 2002 online poll conducted by FIFA.[8] A 2002 Channel 4 poll in the UK saw his performance ranked number 6 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[85]\\nMaradona followed this with two more goals in a semi-final match against Belgium at the Azteca, including another virtuoso dribbling display for the second goal. In the final match, West Germany attempted to contain him by double-marking, but he nevertheless found the space past the West German player Lothar Matthäus to give the final pass to Jorge Burruchaga for the winning goal. Argentina beat West Germany 3–2 in front of 115,000 fans at the Azteca with Maradona lifting the World Cup as captain.[80][86]\\nDuring the tournament, Maradona attempted or created more than half of Argentina\\'s shots, attempted a tournament-best 90 dribbles – three times more than any other player – and was fouled a record 53 times, winning his team twice as many free kicks as any player.[87][88] Maradona scored or assisted 10 of Argentina\\'s 14 goals (71%), including the assist for the winning goal in the final, ensuring that he would be remembered as one of the greatest names in football history.[88][89] By the end of the World Cup, Maradona went on to win the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament by unanimous vote and was widely regarded to have won the World Cup virtually single-handedly, something that he later stated he did not entirely agree with.[88][90][91][92] Zinedine Zidane, watching the 1986 World Cup as a 14-year-old, stated Maradona \"was on another level\".[93] In a tribute to him, Azteca Stadium authorities built a statue of him scoring the \"Goal of the Century\" and placed it at the entrance of the stadium.[94]\\nRegarding Maradona\\'s performance at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, in 2014, Roger Bennett of ESPN FC described it as \"the most virtuoso performance a World Cup has ever witnessed,\"[95] while Kevin Baxter of the Los Angeles Times called it \"one of the greatest individual performances in tournament history,\"[96] with Steven Goff of The Washington Post dubbing his performance as \"one of the finest in tournament annals.\"[97] In 2002, Russell Thomas of The Guardian described Maradona\\'s second goal against England in the 1986 World Cup quarter-finals as \"arguably the greatest individual goal ever.\"[98] In a 2009 article for CBC Sports, John Molinaro described the goal as \"the greatest ever scored in the tournament – and, maybe, in soccer.\"[99] In a 2018 article for Sportsnet, he added: \"No other player, not even Pel[é] in 1958 nor Paolo Rossi in 1982, had dominated a single competition the way Maradona did in Mexico.\" He also went on to say of Maradona\\'s performance: \"The brilliant Argentine artist single-handedly delivered his country its second World Cup.\" Regarding his two memorable goals against England in the quarter-finals, he commented: \"Yes, it was Maradona’s hand, and not God’s, that was responsible for the first goal against England. But while the \\'Hand of God\\' goal remains one of the most contentious moments in World Cup history, there can be no disputing that his second goal against England ranks as the greatest ever scored in the tournament. It transcended mere sports – his goal was pure art.\"[100]\\nMaradona captained Argentina again in the 1990 World Cup in Italy to yet another World Cup final. An ankle injury affected his overall performance, and he was much less dominant than four years earlier, and the team were missing three of their best players due to injury. After losing their opening game to Cameroon at the San Siro in Milan, Argentina were almost eliminated in the first round, only qualifying in third position from their group. In the round of 16 match against Brazil in Turin, Claudio Caniggia scored the only goal after being set up by Maradona.[101]\\nIn the quarter-final, Argentina faced Yugoslavia in Florence; the match ended 0–0 after 120 minutes, with Argentina advancing in a penalty shootout even though Maradona\\'s kick, a weak shot to the goalkeeper\\'s right, was saved. The semi-final against the host nation Italy at Maradona\\'s club stadium in Naples, the Stadio San Paolo, was also resolved on penalties after a 1–1 draw. This time, however, Maradona was successful with his effort, daringly rolling the ball into the net with an almost exact replica of his unsuccessful kick in the previous round. At the final in Rome, Argentina lost 1–0 to West Germany, the only goal being a controversial penalty scored by Andreas Brehme in the 85th minute, after Rudi Völler was adjudged to be fouled.[101]\\nAt the 1994 World Cup in the United States, Maradona played in only two games (both at the Foxboro Stadium near Boston), scoring one goal against Greece, before being sent home after failing a drug test for ephedrine doping.[102] After scoring Argentina\\'s third goal against Greece, Maradona had one of the most remarkable World Cup goal celebrations as he ran towards one of the sideline cameras shouting with a distorted face and bulging eyes, in sheer elation of his return to international football.[103] This turned out to be Maradona\\'s last international goal for Argentina.[103] In the second game, a 2–1 victory over Nigeria which was to be his last game for Argentina, he set up both of his team\\'s goals on free kicks, the second an assist to Caniggia, in what were 2 very strong showings by the Argentine team.[104]\\nIn his autobiography, Maradona argued that the test result was due to his personal trainer giving him the energy drink Rip Fuel. His claim was that the U.S. version, unlike the Argentine one, contained the chemical and that, having run out of his Argentine dosage, his trainer unwittingly bought the U.S. formula. FIFA expelled him from USA \\'94, and Argentina were subsequently eliminated in the round of 16 by Romania in Los Angeles, having been a weaker team without Maradona, even with players like Gabriel Batistuta and Cannigia on the squad. Maradona also separately claimed that he had an agreement with FIFA, on which the organization reneged, to allow him to use the drug for weight loss before the competition in order to be able to play.[105] His failed drug test at the 1994 World Cup signalled the end of his international career, which lasted 17 years and yielded 34 goals from 91 games, including one winner\\'s medal and one runners-up medal in the World Cup.[106]\\nOutwith official internationals, Maradona also played and scored for an Argentina XI against the World XI in 1978 to mark the first anniversary of their first World Cup win,[107][108] scored for The Americas against the World in a UNICEF fundraiser a short time after the 1986 triumph,[107][108] a year after that captained the \\'Rest of the World\\' against the English Football League XI to celebrate the organisation\\'s centenary (after reportedly securing a £100,000 appearance fee)[109][110] and was on the scoresheet for the Argentina XI once more in his own \\'farewell match\\' in 2001.[111]\\nDescribed as a \"classic number 10\" in the media,[112] Maradona was a traditional playmaker who usually played in a free role, either as an attacking midfielder behind the forwards, or as a second striker in a front–two,[113][114][115] although he was also deployed as an offensive–minded central midfielder in a 4–4–2 formation on occasion.[116][117][118][119] Maradona was renowned for his dribbling ability, vision, close ball control, passing, and creativity, and is considered to have been one of the most skilful players in the sport.[92][120][121] He had a compact physique, and with his strong legs, low center of gravity, and resulting balance, he could withstand physical pressure well while running with the ball, despite his small stature,[95][122][123] while his acceleration, quick feet, and agility, combined with his dribbling skills and close control at speed, allowed him to change direction quickly, making him difficult for opponents to defend against.[124][125][126][127]\\nOn his dribbling ability, former Dutch player Johan Cruyff saw similarities between Maradona and Lionel Messi with the ball seemingly attached to their boot.[128][129][130] His physical strengths were illustrated by his two goals against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup. Although he was known for his penchant for undertaking individual runs with the ball,[131] he was also a strategist and an intelligent team player, with excellent spatial awareness, as well as being highly technical with the ball. He was effective in limited spaces, and would attract defenders only to quickly dash out of the melee (as in the second goal against England in 1986),[132][133][134][135] or give an assist to a free teammate. Being short, but strong, he could hold the ball long enough with a defender on his back to wait for a teammate making a run or to find a gap for a quick shot. He showed leadership qualities on the field and captained Argentina in their World Cup campaigns of 1986, 1990, and 1994.[136][137] While he was primarily a creative playmaker, Maradona was also known for his finishing and goalscoring ability.[92][138] Former Milan manager Arrigo Sacchi also praised Maradona for his defensive work-rate off the ball in a 2010 interview with Il Corriere dello Sport.[139]\\nThe team leader on and off the field – he would speak up on a range of issues on behalf of the players – Maradona\\'s ability as a player and his overpowering personality had a major positive effect on his team, with his 1986 World Cup teammate Jorge Valdano stating:\\nMaradona was a technical leader: a guy who resolved all difficulties that may come up on the pitch. Firstly, he was in charge of making the miracles happen, that\\'s something that gives team-mates a lot of confidence. Secondly, the scope of his celebrity was such that he absorbed all the pressures on behalf of his team-mates. What I mean is: one slept soundly the night before a game not just because you knew you were playing next to Diego and Diego did things no other player in the world could do, but also because unconsciously we knew that if it was the case that we lost then Maradona would shoulder more of the burden, would be blamed more, than the rest of us. That was the kind of influence he exercised on the team.[140] Lauding the \"charisma\" of Maradona, another of his Argentina teammates, prolific striker Gabriel Batistuta, stated, \"Diego could command a stadium, have everyone watch him. I played with him and I can tell you how technically decisive he was for the team\".[141] Napoli\\'s former president – Corrado Ferlaino – commented on Maradona\\'s leadership qualities during his time with the club in 2008, describing him as \"a coach on the pitch.\"[142]\\n\"Even if I played for a million years, I\\'d never come close to Maradona. Not that I\\'d want to anyway. He\\'s the greatest there\\'s ever been.\"\\n—Lionel Messi, the player most closely identified with the \"New Maradona\" label[73]\\nOne of Maradona\\'s trademark moves was dribbling full-speed on the right wing, and on reaching the opponent\\'s goal line, delivering accurate passes to his teammates. Another trademark was the rabona, a reverse-cross pass shot behind the leg that holds all the weight.[143] This manoeuvre led to several assists, such as the cross for Ramón Díaz\\'s header against Switzerland in 1980.[144] Moreover, he was also a well–known proponent of the roulette, a feint which involved him dragging the ball back first with one foot and then the other, while simultaneously performing a 360° turn; due to his penchant for using this move, it has even occasionally been described as the \"Maradona turn\" in the media.[145] He was also a dangerous free kick and penalty kick taker, who was renowned for his ability to bend the ball from corners and direct set pieces.[146][147][148] Regarded as one of the best dead-ball specialists of all time,[149][150][151][152] his free kick technique, which often saw him raise his knee at a high angle when striking the ball, thus enabling him to lift it high over the wall, allowed him to score free kicks even from close range, within 22 to 17 yards (20 to 16 metres) from the goal, or even just outside the penalty area.[153] His style of taking free kicks influenced several other specialists, including Gianfranco Zola,[151] Andrea Pirlo,[154] and Lionel Messi.[155]\\nMaradona was famous for his cunning personality.[156] Some critics view his controversial \"Hand of God\" goal at the 1986 World Cup as a clever manoeuvre, with one of the opposition players, Glenn Hoddle, admitting that Maradona had disguised it by flicking his head at the same time as palming the ball.[157] The goal itself has been viewed as an embodiment of the Buenos Aires shanty town Maradona was brought up in and its concept of viveza criolla—\"cunning of the criollos\".[158] Although critical of the illegitimate first goal, England striker Gary Lineker conceded, \"When Diego scored that second goal against us, I felt like applauding. It was impossible to score such a beautiful goal. He\\'s the greatest player of all time, by a long way. A genuine phenomenon.\"[16] Maradona used his hand in the 1990 World Cup, again without punishment, and this time on his own goal line, to prevent the Soviet Union from scoring.[159] A number of publications have referred to Maradona as the Artful Dodger, the urchin pickpocket from Charles Dickens\\' Oliver Twist.[160][161][162][163]\\nMaradona was dominantly left-footed, often using his left foot even when the ball was positioned more suitably for a right-footed connection.[164] His first goal against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup semi-final is a worthy indicator of such; he had run into the inside right channel to receive a pass but let the ball travel across to his left foot, requiring more technical ability. During his run past several England players in the previous round for the \"Goal of the Century\" he did not use his right foot once, despite spending the whole movement on the right-hand side of the pitch. In the 1990 World Cup second-round tie against Brazil, he used his right foot to set up the winning goal for Claudio Caniggia due to two Brazilian markers forcing him into a position that made use of his left foot less practical.[165]\\nPelé scored more goals. Lionel Messi has won more trophies. Both have lived more stable lives than the overweight former cocaine addict who tops this list, whose relationship with football became increasingly strained the longer his career continued. If you\\'ve seen Diego Maradona with a football at his feet, you\\'ll understand.Maradona is widely regarded as the best player of his generation.[133] He is considered one of the greatest players of all time by pundits, players, and managers,[4][73][167] and by some as the best player ever.[166][168][169][170] Known as one of the most skillful players in the game, he is regarded as one of the greatest dribblers[95][122][129][130] and free kick takers in history.[149][150][151][152] A precocious talent in his youth,[5] in addition to his playing ability, Maradona also drew praise from his former manager Menotti for his dedication, determination, and the work-ethic he demonstrated in order to improve the technical aspect of his game in training, despite his natural gifts, with the manager noting: \"I\\'m always cautious about using the word \\'genius\\'. I find it hard to apply that even to Mozart. The beauty of Diego\\'s game has a hereditary element – his natural ease with the ball – but it also owes a lot to his ability to learn: a lot of those brushstrokes, those strokes of \\'genius\\', are in fact a product of his hard work. Diego worked very hard to be the best.\"[171] Maradona\\'s former Napoli manager – Ottavio Bianchi – also praised his discipline in training, commenting: \"Diego is different to the one that they depict. When you got him on his own he was a very good kid. It was beautiful to watch him and coach him. They all speak of the fact that he did not train, but it was not true because Diego was the last person to leave the pitch, it was necessary to send him away because otherwise he would stay for hours to invent free kicks.\"[172] However, although, as Bianchi noted, Maradona was known for making \"great plays\" and doing \"unimaginable\" and \"incredible things\" with the ball during training sessions,[173][174][175] and would even go through periods of rigorous exercise, he was equally known for his limited work-rate in training without the ball, and even gained a degree of infamy during his time in Italy for missing training sessions with Napoli, while he often trained independently instead of with his team.[173][176][177][178]\\nIn a 2019 documentary film on his life, Diego Maradona, Maradona confessed that his weekly regime consisted of \"playing a game on Sunday, going out until Wednesday, then hitting the gym on Thursday.\" Regarding his inconsistent training regimen, the film\\'s director, Asif Kapadia, commented in 2020: \"He had a metabolism. He would look so incredibly out of shape, but then he’d train like crazy and sweat it off by the time matchday came along. His body shape just didn’t look like a footballer, but then he had this ability and this balance. He had a way of being, and that idea of talking to him honestly about how a typical week transpired was pretty amazing.\" He also revealed that Maradona was ahead of his time in the fact that he had a personal fitness coach – Fernando Signorini – who trained him in a variety of areas, in addition to looking after his physical conditioning, adding: \"While he [Maradona] was in a football team he had his own regime. How many players would do that? How many players would even know to think like that? \\'I’m different to anyone else so I need to train at what I’m good at and what I’m weak at.\\' Signorini is very well read and very intelligent. He would literally say, \\'This is the way I’m going to train you, read this book.\\' He would help him psychologically, talk to him about philosophy, and things like that.\"[179][180] Moreover, Maradona was notorious for his poor diet and extreme lifestyle off the pitch, including his use of illicit drugs and alcohol abuse, which along with personal issues, his metabolism, medication that he was prescribed, and periods of inactivity due to injuries and suspensions, led to his significant weight–gain and physical decline as his career progressed; his lack of discipline and difficulties in his turbulent personal life are thought by some in the sport to have negatively impacted his performances and longevity in the later years of his playing career.[171][181][182]\\nA controversial figure in the sport, while he earned critical acclaim from players, pundits, and managers over his playing style, he also drew criticism in the media for his temper and confrontational behaviour, both on and off the pitch.[183][184][185] However, in 2005, Paolo Maldini, described Maradona both as the greatest player he ever faced, and also as the most honest, stating: \"He was a model of good behaviour on the pitch – he was respectful of everyone, from the great players down to the ordinary team member. He was always getting kicked around and he never complained – not like some of today\\'s strikers.\"[186] Franco Baresi stated when he was asked who was his greatest opponent: \"Maradona; when he was on form, there was almost no way of stopping him,\"[56] while fellow former Italy defender Giuseppe Bergomi described Maradona as the greatest player of all time in 2018.[187] Zlatan Ibrahimović said that his off-field antics did not matter, and that he should only be judged for the impact he made on the field. \"For me Maradona is more than football. What he did as a footballer, in my opinion, he will be remembered forever. When you see number 10 who do you think about? Maradona. It is a symbol, even today there are those who choose that number for him.\"[188]\\nToday his skills would afford him greater protection. Back then they merely served as the red rag of provocation that would guarantee he would be the victim of brutal challenges wherever he played. The rules changed as a direct result of some of the injuries Maradona received. When I interviewed him a few years ago, he told me he thought players such as Lionel Messi owed him a great deal because some of the tackles he had endured would never be allowed today.In 1999, Maradona was placed second behind Pelé by World Soccer in the magazine\\'s list of the \"100 Greatest Players of the 20th Century\".[189] Along with Pelé, Maradona was one of the two joint winners of the \"FIFA Player of the Century\" award in 2000,[3] and also placed fifth in \"IFFHS\\' Century Elections\".[190] In a 2014 FIFA poll, Maradona was voted the second-greatest number 10 of all-time, behind only Pelé,[191] and later that year, was ranked second in The Guardian\\'s list of the 100 greatest World Cup players of all-time, ahead of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, once again behind Pelé.[192] In 2017, FourFourTwo ranked him in first place in their list of \"100 greatest players,\"[166] while in 2018, he was ranked in first place by the same magazine in their list of the \"Greatest Football Players in World Cup History\";[193] in March 2020, he was also ranked first by Jack Gallagher of 90min.com in their list of \"Top 50 Greatest Players of All Time\".[194] In May 2020, Sky Sports ranked Maradona as the best player never to have won the UEFA Champions League/European Cup.[195]\\nHounded for years by the press, Maradona once fired a compressed-air rifle at reporters whom he claimed were invading his privacy. This quote from former teammate Jorge Valdano summarizes the feelings of many:\\nHe is someone many people want to emulate, a controversial figure, loved, hated, who stirs great upheaval, especially in Argentina... Stressing his personal life is a mistake. Maradona has no peers inside the pitch, but he has turned his life into a show, and is now living a personal ordeal that should not be imitated.[196]In 1990, the Konex Foundation from Argentina granted him the Diamond Konex Award, one of the most prestigious culture awards in Argentina, as the most important personality in Sports in the last decade in his country. In April 1996, Maradona had a three-round exhibition boxing match with Santos Laciar for charity.[197] In 2000, Maradona published his autobiography Yo Soy El Diego (\"I am The Diego\"), which became a best-seller in Argentina.[198] Two years later, Maradona donated the Cuban royalties of his book to \"the Cuban people and Fidel\".[199]\\nIn 2000, he won FIFA Player of the Century award which was to be decided by votes on their official website, their official magazine and a grand jury. Maradona won the Internet-based poll, garnering 53.6% of the votes against 18.53% for Pelé.[200] In spite of this, and shortly before the ceremony, FIFA added a second award and appointed a \"Football Family\" committee composed of football journalists that also gave to Pelé the title of best player of the century to make it a draw. Maradona also came fifth in the vote of the IFFHS (International Federation of Football History and Statistics).[190] In 2001, the Argentine Football Association (AFA) asked FIFA for authorization to retire the jersey number 10 for Maradona. FIFA did not grant the request, even though Argentine officials have maintained that FIFA hinted that it would.[201]\\nMaradona has topped a number of fan polls, including a 2002 FIFA poll in which his second goal against England was chosen as the best goal ever scored in a World Cup; he also won the most votes in a poll to determine the All-Time Ultimate World Cup Team. On 22 March 2010, Maradona was chosen number 1 in \\'The Greatest 10 World Cup Players of All Time\\' by the London-based newspaper The Times.[202] Argentinos Juniors named its stadium after Maradona on 26 December 2003. In 2003, Maradona was employed by the Libyan footballer Al-Saadi Gaddafi, the third son of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, as a \"technical consultant\", while Al-Saadi was playing for the Italian club, Perugia, which was playing in Serie A at the time.[203]\\nOn 22 June 2005, it was announced that Maradona would return to former club Boca Juniors as a sports vice-president in charge of managing the First Division roster (after a disappointing 2004–05 season, which coincided with Boca\\'s centenary).[205] His contract began 1 August 2005, and one of his first recommendations proved to be very effective: advising the club to hire Alfio Basile as the new coach. With Maradona fostering a close relationship with the players, Boca won the 2005 Apertura, the 2006 Clausura, the 2005 Copa Sudamericana, and the 2005 Recopa Sudamericana.\\nOn 15 August 2005, Maradona made his debut as host of a talk-variety show on Argentine television, La Noche del 10 (\"The Night of the no. 10\"). His main guest on opening night was Pelé; the two had a friendly chat, showing no signs of past differences. However, the show also included a cartoon villain with a clear physical resemblance to Pelé. In subsequent evenings, he led the ratings on all occasions but one. Most guests were drawn from the worlds of football and show business, including Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane, but also included interviews with other notable friends and personalities such as Cuban leader Fidel Castro and boxers Roberto Durán and Mike Tyson.[206] Maradona gave each of his guests a signed Argentina jersey, which Tyson wore when he arrived in Brazil, Argentina\\'s biggest rivals.[207] In November 2005, however, Maradona rejected an offer to work with Argentina\\'s national football team.[208]\\nIn May 2006, Maradona agreed to take part in UK\\'s Soccer Aid (a program to raise money for UNICEF).[209] In September 2006, Maradona, in his famous blue and white number 10, was the captain for Argentina in a three-day World Cup of Indoor Football tournament in Spain. On 26 August 2006, it was announced that Maradona was quitting his position in the club Boca Juniors because of disagreements with the AFA, who selected Alfio Basile to be the new coach of the Argentina national team.[210] In 2008, Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica made Maradona, a documentary about Maradona\\'s life.[211]\\nOn 1 September 2014, Maradona, along with many current and former footballing stars, took part in the \"Match for Peace\", which was played at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with the proceeds being donated entirely to charity.[212] Maradona set up a goal for Roberto Baggio during the first half of the match, with a chipped through-ball over the defence with the outside of his left foot.[213] Unusually, both Baggio and Maradona wore the number 10 shirt, despite playing on the same team.[213] On 17 August 2015, Maradona visited Ali Bin Nasser, the Tunisian referee of the Argentina–England quarter-final match at the 1986 World Cup where Maradona scored his Hand of God, and paid tribute to him by giving him a signed Argentine jersey.[214][215]\\nMaradona began his managerial career alongside former Argentinos Juniors midfield teammate Carlos Fren. The pair led Mandiyú of Corrientes in 1994 and Racing Club in 1995, with little success. In May 2011 he became manager of Dubai club Al Wasl FC in the United Arab Emirates. Maradona was sacked on 10 July 2012.[216][217] In August 2013, Maradona moved on to become mental coach at Argentine club Deportivo Riestra. Maradona departed this role in 2017 to become the head coach of Fujairah, in the UAE second division, before leaving at the end of the season upon failure to secure promotion at the club.[9] In September 2018 he was appointed manager of Mexican second division side Dorados.[12] He made his debut with Dorados on 17 September with a 4–1 victory over Cafetaleros de Tapachula.[218] On 13 June 2019, after Dorados failed to clinch promotion to the Mexican top flight, Maradona\\'s lawyer announced that he would be stepping down from the role, citing health reasons.[219]\\nOn 5 September 2019, Maradona was unveiled as the new head coach of Gimnasia de La Plata, signing a contract until the end of the season.[13] After two months in charge he left the club on 19 November.[220] However, two days later, Maradona rejoined the club as manager saying that \"we finally achieved political unity in the club\".[221] Maradona insisted that Gabriel Pellegrino remain club president if he were to stay with Gimnasia de La Plata.[222][223] However it was still not clear if Pellegrino, who declined to run for re-election,[222][223] would stay on as club President.[222][223] Originally scheduled to be held on 23 November,[222] the election was delayed 15 days.[223] On 15 December, Pellegrino, who was encouraged by Maradona to seek re-election, was re-elected to a three-year term.[224] Despite having a bad record during the 2019–20 season, Gimnasia renewed Maradona\\'s contract on 3 June 2020 for the 2020–21 season.[225]\\nAfter the resignation of Argentina national team coach Alfio Basile in 2008, Maradona immediately proposed his candidacy for the vacant role. According to several press sources, his major challengers included; Diego Simeone, Carlos Bianchi, Miguel Ángel Russo, and Sergio Batista. On 29 October 2008, AFA chairman Julio Grondona confirmed that Maradona would be the head coach of the national team. On 19 November, Maradona managed Argentina for the first time when they played against Scotland at Hampden Park in Glasgow, which Argentina won 1–0.[226]\\nAfter winning his first three matches as the coach of the national team, he oversaw a 6–1 defeat to Bolivia, equalling the team\\'s worst ever margin of defeat. With two matches remaining in the qualification tournament for the 2010 World Cup, Argentina was in fifth place and faced the possibility of failing to qualify, but victory in the last two matches secured qualification for the finals.[227][228] After Argentina\\'s qualification, Maradona used abusive language at the live post-game press conference, telling members of the media to \"suck it and keep on sucking it\".[229] FIFA responded with a two-month ban on all footballing activity, which expired on 15 January 2010, and a CHF 25,000 fine, with a warning as to his future conduct.[230] The friendly match scheduled to take place at home to the Czech Republic on 15 December, during the period of the ban, was cancelled. The only match Argentina played during Maradona\\'s ban was a friendly away to Catalonia, which they lost 4–2.\\nAt the World Cup finals in June 2010, Argentina started by winning 1–0 against Nigeria, followed by a 4–1 victory over South Korea on the strength of a Gonzalo Higuaín hat-trick.[231][232] In the final match of the group stage, Argentina won 2–0 against Greece to win the group and advance to a second round, meeting Mexico.[233] After defeating Mexico 3–1, however, Argentina was routed by Germany 4–0 in the quarter-finals to go out of the competition.[234] Argentina was ranked fifth in the tournament. After the defeat to Germany, Maradona admitted that he was reconsidering his future as Argentina\\'s coach, stating, \"I may leave tomorrow.\"[235] On 15 July, the AFA said that he would be offered a new four-year deal that would keep him in charge through to the summer of 2014 when Brazil staged the World Cup.[236] On 27 July, however, the AFA announced that its board had unanimously decided not to renew his contract, and instead awarded the job to 1978 World Cup winning captain and his 1986 teammate, Daniel Passarella.[237] Afterwards, on 29 July, Maradona claimed that AFA president Julio Grondona and director of national teams (as well as his former Argentine national team and Sevilla coach) Carlos Bilardo had \"lied to\", \"betrayed\", and effectively sacked him from the role. He said, \"They wanted me to continue, but seven of my staff should not go on, if he told me that, it meant he did not want me to keep working.\"[238]\\nBorn to a Roman Catholic family, his parents were Diego Maradona Senior and Dalma Salvadora Franco. Maradona married long-time fiancée Claudia Villafañe on 7 November 1989 in Buenos Aires,[239] and they had two daughters, Dalma Nerea (born 2 April 1987) and Gianinna Dinorah (born 16 May 1989), by whom he became a grandfather in 2009 after she married Sergio Agüero (now divorced).[240]\\nMaradona and Villafañe divorced in 2004. Daughter Dalma has since asserted that the divorce was the best solution for all, as her parents remained on friendly terms. They travelled together to Naples for a series of homages in June 2005 and were seen together on other occasions, including the Argentina games during 2006 World Cup.[241] During the divorce proceedings, Maradona admitted that he was the father of Diego Sinagra (born in Naples on 20 September 1986). The Italian courts had already ruled so in 1993, after Maradona refused to undergo DNA tests to prove or disprove his paternity. Diego Junior met Maradona for the first time in May 2003 after tricking his way onto a golf course in Italy where Maradona was playing.[242] Sinagra is now a footballer playing in Italy.[243]\\nAfter the divorce, Claudia embarked on a career as a theatre producer, and Dalma sought an acting career; she previously had expressed her desire to attend the Actors Studio in Los Angeles.[244][245]\\nMaradona\\'s relationship with his immediate family was a close one, and in a 1990 interview with Sports Illustrated he showed phone bills where he had spent a minimum of 15,000 US dollars per month calling his parents and siblings.[246] Maradona\\'s mother, Dalma, died on 19 November 2011. He was in Dubai at the time, and desperately tried to fly back in time to see her, but was too late. She was 81 years old. His father, \"Don\" Diego, died on 25 June 2015 at age 87.[247]\\nIn 2014, Maradona was accused of assaulting his girlfriend, Rocío Oliva, allegations which he denied.[248][249] In 2017, he gifted her a house in Bella Vista, but in December 2018 they split up.[250] Maradona\\'s great-nephew Hernán López is also a professional footballer.[251]\\nFrom the mid-1980s until 2004, Maradona was addicted to cocaine. He allegedly began using the drug in Barcelona in 1983.[253] By the time he was playing for Napoli, he had a full-blown addiction, which interfered with his ability to play football.[254] In the midst of his drug crisis in 1991, Maradona was asked by journalists if the hit song \"Mi enfermedad\" (lit. \"My Disease\") was dedicated to him.[255]\\nMaradona had a tendency to put on weight and suffered increasingly from obesity, at one point weighing 280\\xa0lb (130\\xa0kg). He was obese from the end of his playing career until undergoing gastric bypass surgery in a clinic in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 6 March 2005. His surgeon said that Maradona would follow a liquid diet for three months in order to return to his normal weight.[256] When Maradona resumed public appearances shortly thereafter, he displayed a notably thinner figure.[257]\\nOn 29 March 2007, Maradona was readmitted to a hospital in Buenos Aires. He was treated for hepatitis and effects of alcohol abuse and was released on 11 April, but readmitted two days later.[258] In the following days, there were constant rumours about his health, including three false claims of his death within a month.[259] After being transferred to a psychiatric clinic specializing in alcohol-related problems, Maradona was discharged on 7 May.[260] On 8 May, Maradona appeared on Argentine television and stated that he had quit drinking and had not used drugs in two and a half years.[261] During the 2018 World Cup match between Argentina and Nigeria, Maradona was shown on television cameras behaving extremely erratically, with an abundance of white residue visible on the glass in front of his seat in the stands. The smudges could have been fingerprints, and he later blamed his behaviour on consuming lots of wine.[262]  In January 2019, Maradona underwent surgery after a hernia caused internal bleeding in his stomach.[263]\\nMaradona showed sympathy to left-wing ideologies.[264] He supported the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and condemned Israel\\'s military strikes on Gaza during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, saying: \"What Israel is doing to the Palestinians is shameful.\"[265] He became friends with Cuban leader Fidel Castro while receiving treatment on the island, with Castro stating, \"Diego is a great friend and very noble, too. There\\'s also no question he’s a wonderful athlete and has maintained a friendship with Cuba to no material gain of his own.\"[73] Maradona had a portrait of Castro tattooed on his left leg and one of Fidel\\'s second in command, fellow Argentine Che Guevara on his right arm.[266] In his autobiography, El Diego, he dedicated the book to various people, including Castro. He wrote, \"To Fidel Castro and, through him, all the Cuban people.\"[267]\\nMaradona voiced support for Bolivia\\'s ousted president Evo Morales[268] and was also a supporter of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. In 2005, he came to Venezuela to meet Chávez, who received him in the Miraflores Palace. After the meeting, Maradona said that he had come to meet a \"great man\" (un grande, which can also mean \"a big man\", in Spanish), but had instead met a gigantic man (un gigante). He also stated, \"I believe in Chávez, I am a Chavista. Everything Fidel does, everything Chávez does, for me is the best.\"[269] Maradona was Chávez\\'s guest of honour at the opening game of the 2007 Copa América held in Venezuela.[270]\\nMany sportsmen claim to be champions of the people, but Maradona\\'s populism is underwritten by his itinerary — the proletarian strongholds of Buenos Aires, Naples, and now Havana.In 2004, he participated in a protest against the U.S.-led war in Iraq.[264] Maradona declared his opposition to what he identified as imperialism, particularly during the 2005 Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina. There he protested George W. Bush\\'s presence in Argentina, wearing a T-shirt labelled \".mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace}STOP BUSH\" (with the \"s\" in \"Bush\" being replaced with a swastika) and referring to Bush as \"human garbage\".[272][273] In August 2007, Maradona went further, making an appearance on Chávez\\'s weekly television show Aló Presidente and saying, \"I hate everything that comes from the United States. I hate it with all my strength.\"[274] By December 2008, however, Maradona had adopted a more pro-U.S. attitude and expressed admiration for Bush\\'s successor, then-President-elect Barack Obama, for whom he had great expectations.[204]\\n\"I asked myself, \\'Who is this man? Who is this footballing magician, this Sex Pistol of international football, this cocaine victim who kicked the habit, looked like Falstaff and was as weak as spaghetti?\\' If Andy Warhol had still been alive, he would have definitely put Maradona alongside Marilyn Monroe and Mao Tse-tung. I\\'m convinced that if he hadn’t been a footballer, he\\'d\\'ve become a revolutionary.\"\\n—Emir Kusturica, film director[73]\\nWith his poor shanty town (villa miseria) upbringing, Maradona cultivated a man-of-the-people persona.[275] During a meeting with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in 1987, they clashed on the issue of wealth disparity, with Maradona stating, \"I argued with him because I was in the Vatican and I saw all these golden ceilings and afterwards I heard the Pope say the Church was worried about the welfare of poor kids. Sell your ceiling then, amigo, do something!\"[275] In September 2014, Maradona met with Pope Francis in Rome, crediting Francis for inspiring him to return to religion after many years away; he stated, \"We should all imitate Pope Francis. If each one of us gives something to someone else, no one in the world would be starving.\"[276]\\nIn December 2007, Maradona presented a signed shirt with a message of support to the people of Iran: it is displayed in the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs\\' museum.[277] In April 2013, Maradona visited the tomb of Hugo Chávez and urged Venezuelans to elect the late leader\\'s designated successor, Nicolás Maduro, to continue the socialist leader\\'s legacy; \"Continue the struggle,\" Maradona said on television.[278] Maradona attended Maduro\\'s final campaign rally in Caracas, signing footballs and kicking them to the crowd, and presented Maduro with an Argentina jersey.[278] Having visited Chávez\\'s tomb with Maradona, Maduro said, \"Speaking with Diego was very emotional because comandante Chávez also loved him very much.\"[278] Maradona participated and danced at the electoral campaign rally during the 2018 presidential elections in Venezuela.[279][280] During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, the Mexican Football Federation fined him for violating their code of ethics and dedicating a team victory to Nicolás Maduro.[281]\\nMaradona in his 2000 autobiography Yo Soy El Diego, linked the \"Hand of God\" goal against England at the 1986 World Cup to the Falklands War: \"Although we had said before the game that football had nothing to do with the Malvinas [Falklands] War, we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds. And this was revenge.\"[282] In October 2015, Maradona thanked Queen Elizabeth II and the Houses of Parliament in London for giving him the chance to provide \"true justice\" as head of an organization designed to help young children.[283] In a video released on his official Facebook page, Maradona confirmed he would accept their nomination for him to become Latin American director for the non-governmental organization Football for Unity.[283]\\nIn March 2009, Italian officials announced that Maradona still owed the Italian government €37\\xa0million in local taxes, €23.5\\xa0million of which was accrued interest on his original debt. They reported that at that point, Maradona had paid only €42,000, two luxury watches and a set of earrings.[284][285]\\nOn 2 November 2020, Maradona was admitted to a hospital in La Plata, supposedly for psychological reasons. A representative of the ex-footballer said his condition was not serious.[286] A day later, he underwent emergency brain surgery to treat a subdural hematoma.[287] He was released on 12 November after successful surgery and was supervised by doctors as an outpatient.[288] On 25 November, at the age of 60, Maradona suffered cardiac arrest and died in his sleep at his home in Dique Luján, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina.[289][290] Maradona\\'s coffin – draped in Argentina\\'s national flag and three Maradona number 10 shirts (Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors and Argentina) –  lay in state at the Presidential Palace, the Casa Rosada, with mourners filing past his coffin.[291] On 26 November, Maradona\\'s wake, which was attended by tens of thousands of people, was cut short by his family as his coffin was relocated from the rotunda of the Presidential Palace after fans took over an inner courtyard and also clashed with police.[292][293] The same day, a private funeral service was held and Maradona was buried next to his parents at the Jardín de Bella Vista cemetery in Bella Vista, Buenos Aires.[294]\\n\"I have lost a great friend and the world has lost a legend. There\\'s still so much to be said, but for now, may God give strength to his relatives. One day I hope we can play football together in heaven.\"\\n— Pelé paying tribute following Maradona\\'s death[295]\\nIn a statement on social media, the Argentine Football Association expressed \"its deepest sorrow for the death of our legend\", adding: \"You will always be in our hearts.\"[296] President Alberto Fernández announced three days of national mourning.[297] UEFA and CONMEBOL announced that every match in the Champions League, Europa League, Copa Libertadores, and Copa Sudamericana would hold a moment of silence prior to kickoff.[298][299] Boca Juniors\\' game was postponed in respect to Maradona.[300] Subsequently, other confederations around the world followed suit, with every fixture observing a minute of silence, starting with the 2020 AFC Champions League\\'s fixtures.[301] In addition to the minute of silence in Serie A, an image of Maradona was projected on stadium screens in the 10th minute of play.[302]\\nIn Naples, the Stadio San Paolo—officially renamed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on 4 December 2020—was illuminated at night in honour of Maradona, with numerous fans gathering outside the stadium placing murals and paintings as a tribute. Both Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and the mayor of Naples Luigi de Magistris expressed their desire to rename their stadium after Maradona, which was unanimously approved by Naples City Council.[64] Prior to Napoli\\'s Europa League match against Rijeka the day after Maradona\\'s death, all of the Napoli players wore shirts with \"Maradona 10\" on the back of them, before observing a minute of silence.[303] Figures in the sport from every continent around the world also paid tribute to him.[295][304][305] Celebrities and other sports people outside football also paid tribute to Maradona.[306][307][308][309][310]\\nOn 27 November 2020, the Aditya School of Sports in Barasat, Kolkata, India named their cricket stadium after Maradona.[311] Three years earlier Maradona had conducted a workshop with 100 kids in the stadium and played a charity match at the same venue with former Indian cricket captain, Sourav Ganguly.[311] The AFA announced that the 2020 Copa de la Liga Profesional, which is the debut season of Copa de la Liga Profesional, would be renamed Copa Diego Armando Maradona.[312] On 28 November, Pakistan Football Federation\\'s main cup PFF National Challenge Cup honoured Maradona along with Wali Mohammad.[313][314] In a rugby union test match between Argentina and New Zealand on 28 November, as the New Zealand team lined up to perform the haka their captain Sam Cane presented a black jersey with Maradona\\'s name and his number 10.[315] On 29 November, compatriot Lionel Messi scored in Barcelona\\'s 4–0 home win over Osasuna in La Liga, dedicating his goal to Maradona by revealing a Newell\\'s Old Boys shirt worn by the latter under his own, and subsequently pointing to the sky.[316]\\nOn 30 November, after Boca Juniors opened the scoring against Newell\\'s Old Boys at La Bombonera, the club\\'s players paid an emotional tribute by laying a Maradona jersey in front of his private suite where his daughter Dalma was present.[317]\\nIn May 2021, seven medical professionals were charged with homicide over Maradona\\'s death as they violated their duties, and could face between 8 and 25 years in prison if convicted.[318] On 25 June, psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov was summoned by the Prosecution Office of San Isidro and faced a formal questioning, where she accepted to answer more than 100 queries regarding the medical treatment given to Maradona in that medical field.[319][320] After seven hours of questioning, Cosachov\\'s lawyer Vadim Mischanchuk addressed the press and denied that Cosachov\\'s prescription medication could have worsened Maradona\\'s heart condition, and Cosachov further denied any responsibility in the death.[321] On 28 June, multiple arrest warrants were requested by a plaintiff lawyer against Cosachov, personal doctor Leopoldo Luque, psychologist Carlos Díaz, and doctor Nancy Forlini in direct connection with Maradona\\'s alleged negligent death.[322] On 1 July, the prosecutors in the case rejected to ask a judge to issue the arrest warrants against all the aforementioned professionals on the basis that they considered the request had been a \"mediatic stunt\" for the case and added that the requester of the arrest warrants wanted a \"TV show stunt\" in consideration of the timing with personal doctor Luque\\'s interrogation.[323][324]\\nThe American newspaper Houston Chronicle wrote of Maradona:\\nTo understand the gargantuan shadow Maradona casts over his football-mad homeland, one has to conjure up the athleticism of Michael Jordan, the power of Babe Ruth – and the human fallibility of Mike Tyson. Lump them together in a single barrel-chested man with shaggy black hair and you have El Diego, idol to the millions who call him D10S, a mashup of his playing number and the Spanish word for God.[325]In Argentina, Maradona is considered an icon. Concerning the idolatry that exists in his country, former teammate Jorge Valdano said, \"At the time that Maradona retired from active football, he left Argentina traumatized. Maradona was more than just a great footballer. He was a special compensation factor for a country that in a few years lived through several military dictatorships and social frustrations of all kinds.\" Valdano added that \"Maradona offered to Argentines a way out of their collective frustration, and that\\'s why people there love him as a divine figure.\"[326] In leading his nation to the 1986 World Cup, and in particular his performance and two goals in the quarter-final against England, Guillem Balagué writes: \"That Sunday in Mexico City, the world saw one man single-handedly – in more than one sense of the phrase – lift the mood of a depressed and downtrodden nation into the stratosphere. With two goals in the space of four minutes, he allowed them to dare to dream that they, like him, could be the best in the world. He did it first by nefarious and then spellbindingly brilliant means. In those moments, he went from star player to legend.\"[39]\\nSince 1986, it has been common for Argentines abroad to hear Maradona\\'s name as a token of recognition, even in remote places.[38] The Tartan Army sing a version of the Hokey Cokey in honour of the Hand of God goal against England.[327] In Argentina, Maradona is often talked about in terms reserved for legends. In the Argentine film El hijo de la novia (\"Son of the Bride\"), somebody who impersonates a Catholic priest says to a bar patron, \"They idolized him and then crucified him.\" When a friend scolds him for taking the prank too far, the fake priest retorts, \"But I was talking about Maradona.\" He is the subject of the film El camino de San Diego, though he himself only appears in archive footage.[328]\\nMaradona was included in many cameos in the Argentine comic book El Cazador de Aventuras. After the closing of it, the authors started a new short-lived comic book titled El Die, using Maradona as the main character. Maradona has had several online Flash games that are entirely dedicated to his legacy.[329] In Rosario, Argentina, locals organized the parody religion of the \"Church of Maradona\". The organization reformulates many elements from Christian tradition, such as Christmas or prayers, reflecting instead details from Maradona. It had 200 founding members, and tens of thousands more have become members via the church\\'s official web site.[330]\\nMany Argentine artists performed songs in tribute to Diego, such as \"La Mano de Dios\" by El Potro Rodrigo, \"Maradona\" by Andrés Calamaro, \"Para siempre Diego\" (Diego Forever) by Los Ratones Paranoicos, \"Francotirador\" (Sniper) by Attaque 77, \"Maradona Blues\" by Charly García, \"Santa Maradona\" (Saint Maradona) by Mano Negra, and \"La Vida Tómbola\" by Manu Chao, among others. There are also other films, such as: Maradona, La Mano de Dios (Maradona, the Hand of God), Amando a Maradona (Loving Maradona), and Maradona by Kusturica.[211]\\nBy 1982, Maradona had become one of the biggest sports stars in the world and had endorsements with many companies, including Puma and Coca-Cola, earning him an additional $1.5\\xa0million per year on top of his club salary.[331] In 1982, he featured in a World Cup commercial for Coca-Cola, and a Japanese commercial for Puma.[331] In 1984 he earned $7m a year at Napoli, and sponsorships included $5m from Hitachi.[271] In 1984, a poll from IMG named Maradona the best known person in the world.[271] In 2010 he appeared in a commercial for French fashion house Louis Vuitton, indulging in a game of table football with fellow World Cup winners Pelé and Zinedine Zidane.[332] Maradona featured in the music video to the 2010 World Cup song \"Waka Waka\" by Shakira, with footage shown of him celebrating Argentina winning the 1986 World Cup.[333]\\nA 2006 television commercial for Brazilian soft drink Guaraná Antarctica portrayed Maradona as a member of the Brazil national team, including wearing the yellow jersey and singing the Brazilian national anthem with Brazilian players Ronaldo and Kaká.[334] Later on in the commercial he wakes up realizing it was a nightmare after having too much of the drink. This generated some controversy in the Argentine media after its release (although the commercial was not supposed to air for the Argentine market, fans could see it online). Maradona replied that he had no problem in wearing the Brazilian national squad jersey despite Argentina and Brazil having a tense rivalry in football, but that he would refuse to wear the shirt of River Plate, Boca Juniors\\' traditional rival.[335] There is a documented phenomenon of Brazilians being named in honour of Maradona,[336] an example being footballer Diego Costa.[337]\\nIn 2017, Maradona featured as a legendary player in the football video games FIFA 18 and Pro Evolution Soccer 2018.[338] In 2019, a documentary film titled Diego Maradona was released by Academy Award and BAFTA Award winning filmmaker Asif Kapadia, director of Amy (on singer Amy Winehouse) and Senna (on motor racing driver Ayrton Senna). Kapadia stated that \"\\n...Maradona is the third part of a trilogy about child geniuses and fame.\"[339] He added, \"...I was fascinated by his journey, wherever he went there were moments of incredible brilliance and drama. He was a leader, taking his teams to the very top, but also many lows in his career. He was always the little guy fighting against the system... and he was willing to do anything, to use all of his cunning and intelligence to win.\"[340]\\nMaradona made 694 appearances and scored 354 goals for club and country combined, with a goalscoring average of 0.51.\\nNotes\\nNotes\\nBoca Juniors[344]\\nBarcelona[344]\\nNapoli[344]\\nArgentina U20\\nArgentina\\nIndividual\\n'"
